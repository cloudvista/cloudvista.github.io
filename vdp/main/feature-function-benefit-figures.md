Not a move overnight
Huge maintenance issue
What happens to services that cerner does not address?

We can help data migration, but that is not the centerpiece of our work

What about services that VA needs that are not provided by Cerner?  We should not wait and continue to run 130 systems (forever).  If its $19B to maintain Vistax130, we need to more proactively


JH: turn up cerner
VDP: turn off vista
