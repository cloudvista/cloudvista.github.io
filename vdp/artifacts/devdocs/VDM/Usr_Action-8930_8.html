<p>This file encodes actions which occur in connection with clinical narrative documents.   These actions are referenced by entries in the User Authorization/Subscription file to associate users with actions.   This file contains 2 kinds of actions: those a user is authorized to perform on a document, and those a user subscribes to for a document.  For example, a user is authorized to perform the Signature action, but a user subscribes to (“signs up to receive”) a Notification action.</p>
