<h1 id="usr-class-membership-89303">Usr Class Membership (8930.3)</h1>
<p>This file links a person from the New Person file to a class in the User Class file.  Since user class membership includes members of all subclasses, users should be made members of the most discrete class in a hierarchy of classes.  For example, if Jones is a dentist, Jones should be entered into the Dentist class.  Since Dentist is a subclass of the Provider class, Jones is then automatically a Provider.   Persons wearing several different hats can have more than one entry in the file.  For example, Smith might be a dietician also working toward a nursing degree.  Smith could be entered twice, once as a Dietician and once as a Student Nurse.</p>
