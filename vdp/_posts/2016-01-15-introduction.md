The Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the comprehensive integrated inpatient-outpatient health information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For the past 35 years, a national network of 131 VISTA systems have provided all clinical, financial, and administrative functions to support the operations of over 1200  VA hospitals and clinics throughout the United States. As such it is the world's largest longitudinal health information system, and comprises over 15 petabytes of veteran health data.

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric approach to comprehensively surfacing, representing, and managing the thirty-five years of patient data and institutional know-how currently in all VA VISTA systems using a modern  web-standard machine-processable Linked Data Model; and by enriching and operationalizing this model, make all relevant VISTA data securely accessible and computable across all VA VISTA systems through one single, standardized Master VISTA data model.
