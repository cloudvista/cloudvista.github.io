## CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT RECORDS

1000	Records Common to Most Offices within Agencies (GRS 23)


VHA RECORDS CONTROL SCHEDULE 10-1

1. PURPOSE

The Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 provides Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records retention and disposition requirements for VHA Central Office, Program Offices, and field facilities.  The primary purpose of this revision is to incorporate changes to RCS 10-1 issued since the last publication date of March 20, 2017. The schedule is divided into eight chapters.  Each chapter covers a group of records, e.g., chapter one covers administrative records.  The first four chapters include most of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules (GRS).  Space for additional records schedules is available to allow for future expansion.  The VHA Records Management Office intends to update this schedule every three years in order to publish the most up to date records management requirements.  Between updates the VHA Records Management Office will post new or revised schedules on the HIM/RM (Health Information Management/Records Management) website.  Schedules are not required to be in the RCS 10-1 to be a legal schedule. Once a schedule is approved by the Archivist of the United States it must be used to manage the agencyÕs records.


2. INTRODUCTION

a. Title 44, Section 3301, of the United States (U.S.) Code defines records as Òall books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials or other documentary materials, regardless of the physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the U.S. Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the information value of data in them.  Library and museum material made or
acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience or reference, and stocks of publications and of processed documents are not included. These items are referred to as non-record materials.

b. The VHA Records Control Schedule (RCS) 10-1 is the main authority for the retention and disposition requirements of VHA records.  It provides a brief description of the records and states the retention period and disposition requirements.  It also provides the NARA disposition authorities or the GRS authorities, whichever is appropriate for the records, in addition to program and service sections.

c. The GRS provides disposal authorities for temporary administrative records common to all Federal agencies.  It covers records relating to: personnel, budget and finance, procurement, information technology, and other common functions and activities of Federal agencies.  Any deviation from the GRS must be authorized by NARA in accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1228.42(B).  Requests for deviations from either the RCS 10-1 or GRS retention and disposition requirements are to be submitted to the VHA Records Management Office via the Facility requesting the change and the primary VHA Program Office with authority over the record type that is being requested for change.


3. RECORDS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

a. The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Informatics and Analytics (10P2), Executive Director Information Governance (10P2C) Health Information Management/Records Management Office will be referred to as the VHA Records Management Office throughout this document.  The VHA Records Management Office is responsible for developing policies and procedures for effective and efficient records management throughout VHA including VHA Program Offices and Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Centers. In addition, the Office acts as the liaison between VHA and NARA on issues pertaining to records management practices and procedures.

b. VHA Field/Facility Records Managers are responsible for all records management activities at their site.

c. All VHA employees are responsible for ensuring that records are created, maintained, protected, and dispositioned in accordance with NARA regulations and VA policies and procedures.


4. DISPOSITION OF RECORDS

The RCS 10-1 contains retention and disposition requirements for VHA records authorized by NARA or assigned a GRS authority.  Record disposition refers to the transfer of records to an approved records storage facility, transfer of permanent records to NARA, the destruction of records, or other appropriate actions to dispose of records.  Unless retrieved; records transferred to a storage facility shall be dispositioned after expiration of their retention requirements.


5. PERMANENT AND UNSCHEDULED RECORDS

Permanent and unscheduled records in VHA custody must be reported through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA.  Permanent (archival) records are defined as records appraised by NARA to have sufficient historical value or other value to warrant permanent preservation at the NARA.  Un-appraised and unscheduled records are records that have not been evaluated to determine their record retention or disposition.  Such records are to be retained until they receive disposition authority from NARA.  The VHA Program Offices responsible for unscheduled records shall work with the Field/Facility Records Manager, VHA Records Management Office and the VHA Records Officer to identify, describe and submit to NARA a request for disposition authority using the NARA electronic Records Archives (ERA) system.



6. MEDIA NEUTRAL RECORDS

a. A media neutral schedule item on a records disposition schedule (i.e., SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority or NARA Electronic Records Archives (ERA) records scheduling module)  applies to the described records regardless of their medium.  Program offices must submit a new schedule request through the VHA Records Management Office to NARA for approval of electronic versions of previously scheduled records if:

(1) The content and function of the records have changed significantly (e.g., the electronic records contain information that is substantially different from the information included in the hard copy series or are used for different purposes).

(2) The previously approved schedule explicitly excluded electronic records.
(3) The electronic records consist of program records maintained on an agency Web site. (4) The electronic records consist of temporary program records maintained in a format
other than scanned image AND the previously approved schedule is not media neutral.

b. Temporary still pictures, sound recordings, motion picture film, and video recordings.  Apply the previously approved schedule to digital versions.

c. Scanned images of temporary records, including temporary program records.  Apply the previously approved schedule.

d. Other temporary records maintained in an electronic format other than scanned images:

(1) For temporary records that are covered by an item in the GRS (other than those GRS items that exclude electronic master files and databases) or an agency-specific schedule that pertains to administrative housekeeping activities, apply the previously approved schedule.  If the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple hard copy series, apply the previously approved schedule item with the longest retention period.  This is common when creating an electronic system that replaces a number of paper and electronic record types.  The older systems and paper records are now placed into a new system.  In the past these records may have covered various disposition life cycles. In the case of finance records the range could have been from one to six years.  If the records in the new electronic system cannot be dispositioned separately then they must be kept for the longest disposition, in this case six years.

(2) For temporary program records covered by a NARA-approved media neutral schedule item (i.e., the item appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval before December 17, 2007, that is explicitly stated to be media neutral, or it appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, that is not explicitly limited to a specific recordkeeping medium), are considered media neutral.  An example of this is the Health Records Folder File or Consolidated Health Record (CHR).  The original NARA approved records disposition schedule was NARA (Job No. N1-15-91-6 item 1).  This schedule was written and approved in 1991 and was for the paper health record only.  In 2000 (VHA) created an ÒElectronic Health RecordÓ. Since this record was not paper VHA was required to submit to NARA a request for an electronic record schedule NARA (Job No.N1-15-02-3).  This records schedule was created in
2002 which makes both the paper and electronic health record media neutral for future changes.


7. DAMAGE TO AND UNAUTHORIZED DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS

a. VHA records shall not be disposed of without the proper authorization to do so.  Federal law prohibits unauthorized destruction or mutilation of Federal records.  The penalty for such acts is a $2,000 fine, 3 years in prison, or both pursuant to Title 18 United States Code 2071.  Damage to, and unauthorized destruction of records is to be reported to the VHA Records Office immediately upon knowledge of such an act of destruction.

b. VHA officials must take measures to ensure that records are not disposed of improperly. Records are not to be removed from VHA custody or destroyed without regard to the requirements of this schedule or the GRS.  When records are improperly disposed, NARA regulations and VA policy require the submission of a report to NARA.  The report must include the record description, volume, date of incident, etc.  Specific reporting requirements are contained in NARA regulations, Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1228, Disposition of Federal Records, and VA Handbook 6300.1, Chapter 6., Records Management Procedures.


8. RECORDS FREEZES/LITIGATION HOLDS

a. Records freeze:  Records whose scheduled disposition has been temporarily suspended because of special circumstances that alter the administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records.

b. Litigation hold:  The Office of General Counsel (OGC) may periodically issue a litigation hold or moratorium on the disposition of certain records because the records may be potentially responsive or helpful in ongoing or pending litigation (lawsuits).

c. A "hold" is simply the implementation of a litigation hold notice issued by an OGC Office. Upon receipt, the records manager must suspend the normal disposition cycle of the records
listed in the hold notice to prevent their early/premature disposal.  Holds are placed on records in an agency's physical custody.

d. A "freeze" is created when the records manager receives a hold notice for records not in the agencyÕs physical custody but in the custody of the VA Records Center and Vault (RC&V), a Federal Record Center (FRC), or a commercial records storage facility.  The Facility Records Manager would ask NARA to create a freeze to halt premature disposition of the records.  Since most litigations deal with relatively current agency activity, the number of freezes is significantly smaller than the number of holds since the agency still has physical custody of most records affected by holds.


e. Upon receipt of a hold notice the records manager should initiate a freeze on any off-site records in conjunction with the hold placed on the on-site records in physical custody.  This ensures that any potentially responsive record is preserved regardless of its physical location.

f. The Office of General Counsel maintains a list of litigation holds at the following website: OGC Litigation Share Point:  https://vaww.ogc.vaco.portal.va.gov/litigation/Lists/active/AllItems.aspx

g. Additional information may be found at the following NARA website:
http://www.archives.gov/frc/arcis/freeze-faq.pdf



9. VITAL/ESSENTIAL RECORDS

Vital/Essential records are defined as essential records needed to maintain the continuity of Federal government activities during and following a national emergency or a technological or natural disaster and to protect the rights and interests of VA beneficiaries and employees. Additional information can be found in VA Handbook 6300.2.


10. PERSONAL PAPERS

Personal papers consist of documents that relate only to an individualÕs personal affairs and do not affect the conduct of government business.  Examples of personal papers are diaries, journals or other personal notes that are not created in the process of transacting government business. Personal papers may be disposed of in accordance with the ownerÕs preference.  Note: Personal notes included on an official calendar or files are subject to official records authorities.

11. TERMINATION OF OFFICE/SERVICE AND DEACTIVATION OF FIELD FACILITY

a.  Specific records management procedures are to be followed when terminating an office/service or deactivating a field facility.  The procedures are contained in VA Handbook
6300.1.  It is important to follow these procedures to prevent the loss or unauthorized destruction of VHA records.

b.  Once it has been determined to abolish an office/service or to deactivate a field facility, the office or facility records manager is to be consulted so that certain measures are taken to prevent the premature destruction of records.  An evaluation is to be conducted to determine those records that are eligible for immediate destruction, identify records that are to be transferred to the successor office/service or facility, identify records that are eligible for transfer to a records
storage facility, and identify records of permanent value to be offered to the NARA.  Records are not to be disposed of without proper authority to do so.

12. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) POLICY

a. VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management, provides the policy for records and information management.


b. VA Handbook 6300.1, Records Management Procedures, specifies procedures for implementing the records management program.

c. VA Handbook 6300.2, Management of the Vital Records Program, implements the VA Vital
Records Program which is an integral component of the VA Emergency Preparedness Plan.

d. VA Handbook 6300.8, Procedures for Shipment of Records to the RC&V in Neosho, Missouri, provides procedures for transferring records to the RC&V.

 decisi on  (r eg ar ding  the  Veter an Õs  elig ibil ity  for  further   transplant evaluation) into TRACER a. VATC referral decisions are expected within 5 business days for stable
patients, 48 hours for emergency patients After the VATC enters the decision, the referral submitter and members of the Referring Center Notification Group receive an email notification with link to the referral decision and next steps. TRACER also enables VA medical centers to re-submit referrals, request a second opinion by a different VA transplant center, and submit
 an  Ò Appe alÓ  to  the  Tr an spl ant  S urg ical  Adviso ry 
Board. TRACER enables VA transplant centers to electronically transfer patients from one transplant
center to another.

Temporary; cutoff at end of CY, destroy 20 years after cutoff. (DAA-0015-2016-0006-0003).
6200.6. Pre-Operative Case Management Tool. Before a provider can determine whether a patient is
a candidate for surgery, the patient often needs a
series of preoperative assessments and
procedures. Because VA facility staff are discouraged from using independent mechanisms to track patients, as these may be perceived as unauthorized waitlists, the National Surgery Office (NSO) developed the Pre- Operative Case Management (POCM) tool to track
 patientsÕ   required pre-operative consults, diagnostic tests, and procedures before a determination of surgical candidacy can be made.  The POCM tool is not a waitlist nor intended to be a system of record, and it does not replace existing VA scheduling or medical record systems.  Use of this tool is optional. 

POCM coordinators and/or providers at a facility enter patients and workups ordered by the clinician that they anticipate may delay the determination of surgical candidacy.  Once all workup items are completed, POCM alerts designated personnel the patient information is ready for review. If no additional workups are necessary, surgical candidacy determination is noted and the patient status is set to complete.

Patient workup information is maintained in a SharePoint list for presentation to POCM users while workups are pending. All patient and workup information is also written to a SQL database to provide PHI blinded reporting capabilities. After 30 days, patient data with a Complete status is removed from the SharePoint view.

Temporary; cutoff at end of CY, destroy 10 years after cutoff. (DAA-0015-2016-0006-0004).

6200.8. National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program (NSQIP) Database.

Purpose: To monitor and report non-cardiac surgical procedures performed in any VHA surgical program using unadjusted and risk-adjusted outcomes data.

Temporary; cutoff at end of CY, destroy 20 years after cutoff. (DAA-0015-2016-0006-0006).

6200.9.  VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program
(VASQIP) Database.

Monitors and reports risk-adjusted (O/E) surgical outcomes and actual (unadjusted) mortality for major surgical procedures performed at each VA medical center for all operations combined and for each surgical specialty on a quarterly basis and for the rolling year. An analysis and review of the VA medical center structure and process will be prompted based upon the reporting of a statistically high O/E ratio.
The VASQIP uses logistic regression analysis to calculate the probability of death or complication for each patient in the database, based on the patient's preoperative risk factors. These probabilities can then be summed for all surgical procedures performed by the VHA surgical programs to arrive
at an expected number of events (mortality, morbidity) for all operations including the following surgical specialties: cardiac surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, urology, and vascular surgery. The observed number of events (O) divided by the expected number of events (E) produces the O/E ratio for the procedures performed at any single VA medical center. As reference, an O/E ratio of 1.0 indicates that the observed number of events is equal to the number of events expected
based upon the patient mix in a given specialty at that
VA medical center.
