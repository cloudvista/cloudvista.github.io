## What is the process to create the Master VISTA Data Model?

>__Model Extraction and Transformation__

>* All sources of existing available metadata (both internal to VISTA as well as external, such as business logic from external applications) must be extracted and transformed to a single, integrated, web-centric, industry-standard, machine-processable metadata model. 
* Currently the data model that meets all these criteria is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Resource Description Framework (RDF), also known as Linked Data. 
* This is the same metadata standard used by the National Library of Congress to index all books, the National Library of Medicine to index all medical journals, and all major search engines to index all structured data on the web.

>__Model Integration__

>* Once transformed to Linked Data, all internal and external metadata sources may be combined into a single, comprehensive integrated web-standard data model that spans all data in any VISTA, as well as all relevant external data. 
* This process exposes in machine processible form the real, live, operational __VISTA Data Model__.


>__Model Enrichment__
> 
> * __Annotation__: This integrated data model is then annotated with new data categories to provide the necessary data identification to support master data management of broad categories of data, such as patient data, systems and configuration data, institutional data, and knowledge data.
* __Security__ The patient data annotations will provide the basis of a patient-centric, on-the-data data security model. 
* __Redundancy__: The integrated data model will have much redundancy removed from overlapping definitions within VISTA and its associated applications.   
* __Normalization__: A subset of the integrated model will be used to create a normalized model based on the VA's Virtual Patient Record (VPR).
* __Symmetric Read/Write__: Supplementary metadata will be added to the normalized model to support symmetric read and write (i.e. the read model is the same as the write model). Currently the methods for read and write are completely distinct models and often buried in procedural code. 
* __Enrichment__: All the annotations, normalizations, categorizations, and enhancements to the integrated model are called the enriched model. This enrichment process creating a normalized read/write model creates the __Master VISTA Data Model__. 

>__Model Operationalization__
>
* The Master VISTA Data Model is then operationalized by embedding it directly within the transactional database engine of VISTA as an in-process, server-side  model using the Node.js/MUMPS binding mechanism.  This Node/VISTA wrapper on MUMPS is called nodeVISTA.  


## The Result

The resulting Master VISTA Data Model embedded within the VISTA data engine will provide a server-side, security-enabled, in-process, symmetric read/write Master Data Model that internal and external clients can leverage for transactional, computable data exchange and processing.
