<h1 id="domain-42">Domain (4.2)</h1>
<p>This file is used to name all of the domains to which MailMan messages may be routed.  Each name in this file corresponds to the right side of a MailMan address-the part following the “@”.   Domains may have synonyms, allowing users to name sites with one name, while MailMan uses the more formal Domain Naming conventions.   This file also controls whether messages are queued for immediate transmission and into what queue they are dropped.  Any domain may have a relay domain, which controls the routing as follows:   If a domain has a named relay domain, the message is put in the queue for the relay domain.   If not, and the domain has a TRANSMISSION SCRIPT, then the message is put in the queue for that domain.   Otherwise, the message is put in the queue for the Parent domain, as defined at MailMan initialization time.</p>

These scripts<br />may compete with each other according to their priorities (See the<br />PRIORITY field).  Scripts that use TCP/IP channels should be marked<br />with the type TCPCHAN so that they are ignored during prioritization<br />unless the TCP/IP enabled CPUs have Task Manager running on them, in<br />which case they should be made SMTP type.<br /> <br />In other words, if the physical link is on a CPU that Task Manager runs<br />on the transmission script can be of the type SMTP.  If it is not on such<br />a CPU another type must be chosen.<br /> <br />Other types are TELNET (used for TalkMan or other interactive scripts),<br />FTP (for File Transfers) and Other.</td>
