<h1 id="tiu-document-definition-89251">TIU Document Definition (8925.1)</h1>
<p>This file stores Document Definitions, which identify and define behavior for documents stored in the TIU DOCUMENTS FILE (#8925).  For consistency with the V-file schema, it may be viewed as the “Attribute Dictionary” for the Text Integration Utilities.   It also stores Objects, which can be embedded in a Document Definition’s Boilerplate Text (Overprint). Objects contain M code which gets a piece of data and inserts it in the document’s Boilerplate Text when a document is entered.   Warning: objects embedded in boilerplate text are looked up by multiple index (i.e. DIC(0) contains ‘M’). Current code (see routine CHECK^TIUFLF3) checks all present indexes to make sure object names, abbreviations and print names are not ambiguous for this lookup. If new indexes are added, this code MUST BE UPDATED to check the new index as well.   Some entries in this file are developed Nationally and exported across the country.  Others are created by local sites.  Entries in the first category are marked National Standard and are not editable by sites.   This file does NOT allow multiple entries OF THE SAME TYPE with the same name.  That is, within a given Type, there are no duplicate names. (This refers to the .01 field, the Technical name of the entry.)   This file does not allow a parent to have items with the same name, even if the items have different internal file numbers (i.e. are different file entries).  Again, this refers to the .01 Technical name of the entry.   Because of ownership considerations, the file does NOT allow an entry to be an item under more than 1 parent.  If the same item is desired under more than 1 parent, the item must be copied into a new entry.  There is one exception:  Document Definitions of Type Component which have been marked Shared may have more than one parent.   The Document Definition Utility TIUF categorizes certain fields as Basic, Technical, or Upload, and displays these fields together as a group when user edits or views a Document Definition. BASIC fields include Name, Abbreviation, Print Name, Type, Personal Owner, Class Owner, Status, In Use, Shared, Orphan, Has Boiltxt, National Standard, OK to Distribute, and Suppress Visit Selection. TECHNICAL fields include Entry Action, Exit Action, Edit Template, Print Method, Print Form Header, Print Form Number, Print Group, Allow Custom Form Headers, Visit Linkage Method, Validation Method, and Object Method. UPLOAD fields include Upload Target File, Laygo Allowed, Target Text Field Subscript, Upload Look-up Method, Upload Post-Filing Code, Upload Filing Error Code, and multiples Upload Captioned ASCII Header and Upload Delimited ASCII Header.   The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed field descriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU have extensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of these descriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary for a national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer should check to make sure all online help is still displayed properly.   Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter, edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletion of entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the edit through generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared, and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items is also prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and Print Name of OBJECTS cannot be edited through generic Fileman Options.   This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit other fields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypasses many safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can create havoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses.   If users find needs which are not met through TIUF, please communicate them to the TIU development team.                                                            <strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>***   WARNING: Using generic Fileman options to edit entries can cause SERIOUS database problems.                                  **</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

      <td>The name of a Document Definition entry (.01 field) must be between 3<br />and 60 characters long and may not begin with a punctuation character.<br />Although names can be entered in any case, they are transformed to<br />upper case before being stored.<br /> <br />It functions as the Technical Name of the entry.  Some sites have put KWIC<br />cross references on it to get, say, all Titles from a given Service.<br /> <br />Name can be used when entering documents as the name of the Title being<br />entered.  Print Name and Abbreviation will also be accepted.<br /> <br />Since it is the Technical, .01 Name, the Document Definition Utility<br />(TIUF) uses this name throughout.<br /> <br />The .01 name differs from the Print Name, which appears in lists of<br />documents and functions as the Title of the document.<br /> <br />It also differs from Item Menu Text (1-20 characters), which is used when<br />selecting documents from 3-COLUMN MENUS.<br /> <br />The ORDER of names in TIUF options Edit Document Definitions and Create<br />Document Definitions is by Item Sequence under the parent.  Order is<br />alphabetic by Menu Text if an Item has no Item Sequence.<br /> <br />When a new entry is added to file 8925.1, the Document Definition Utility<br />(TIUF) enters the Name as the default Print Name.  The Print Name can be<br />edited if a different Print Name is desired.<br /> <br />File 8925.1 permits more than 1 entry with the same name as long as they<br />don’t have the same Type.  In that sense, NAMES are reusable.  However,<br />ENTRIES are NOT reusable (except specially marked Components): an entry is<br />NOT allowed to be an item under more than one parent unless it is a Shared<br />Component.  (See Type Component.)<br /> <br />Name is a BASIC Field.<br /> <br />                               OBJECT Name <br />Object Names, like any other names are 3-60 characters, not starting with<br />punctuation.  Sites may want to namespace object names, use the object<br />Print Name as a more familiar name, and use object Abbreviation as a short<br />name to embed in boilerplate text.  Unlike other Types, Object<br />Abbreviation and Print Name as well as Name must be uppercase.<br /> <br />Object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name can be embedded in boilerplate<br />text.  Since TIU must be able to determine from this which object is<br />intended, object Names, Abbreviations, and Print Names must be unique.  In<br />fact, an object Name must differ not only from every other object name,<br />but also from every other object Abbreviation and from every other object<br />Print Name.  Same for Abbreviations and Print Names.  For example, if some<br />object has abbreviation ‘CND’, then ‘CND’ cannot be used for any other<br />object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name.</td>

      <td>Type determines the nature of the entry and what sort of items the entry<br />may have. There are 5 possible types:<br /> <br />CL CLASS:  Classes group documents.<br /> <br />Example: “Progress Notes” is a class with many kinds of progress notes<br />under it.<br /> <br />Classes may themselves be subdivided into items of Type Class or may have<br />items of Type Document Class if no further Class subdivisions are desired.<br /> <br />If a hierarchy deeper than Class-Document Class-Title is desired, Class is<br />the place to insert another level into the hierarchy: Class-Class-Document<br />Class-Title.<br /> <br />Besides grouping documents, Classes also store behavior which is then<br />inherited by lower level entries.<br /> <br />DC DOCUMENT CLASS: Document Classes group documents.  Document Class is<br />the lowest level of class, and has items of Type Title under it.<br /> <br />Example: “Day Pass Note” could be a Document Class under class Progress<br />Note.<br /> <br />Document Classes also store behavior which is then inherited by lower<br />entries.<br /> <br />TL TITLE:  Titles are used to enter documents.  They store the behavior<br />of the documents which use them.<br /> <br />Titles may have predefined boilerplate (“Overprint”) text.  They may have<br />Components as items.  Boilerplate Text can have objects in it.<br /> <br />Examples: “Routine Day Pass Note” could be a Title under document class<br />Day Pass Note.  Another example might be “Exceptional Circumstances Day<br />Pass Note.”<br /> <br />Titles store their own behavior.  They also inherit behavior from higher<br />levels of the hierarchy.  However, behavior stored in the Title itself<br />overrides inherited behavior.<br /> <br />CO COMPONENT: Components are “sections” or “pieces” of documents.<br />In the Hierarchy, Components are hung as items from Titles.<br /> <br />Examples: “Reason for Pass” could be a component of Routine Day Pass Note.<br />Subjective is a component of a SOAP Note.<br /> <br />Components may have (sub)Components as items.  They may have Boilerplate<br />Text.  Components may be designated Shared (see Field Description for<br />Shared). Shared Components are shown in Document Definition Utility<br />Displays as Type: ‘CO S’.<br /> <br />There are advantages and disadvantages in splitting a document up into<br />separate components (rather than writing sections into the Boilerplate<br />Text of the Title): Since Components are stored as separate file entries,<br />they are inherently accessable and even ‘moveable’. Using Fileman, sites<br />can access components of documents the same way they can access documents<br />for reports, etc.. Also, in the future, TIU may have options to move/copy<br />certain components from one document into another.  The disadvantage is<br />speed: Components make the structure more complex and therefore slow down<br />processing.<br /> <br />O OBJECT: Objects are names which may be embedded in the predefined<br />boilerplate text of Titles. Example: ‘PATIENT AGE’.  Objects are typed<br />into the boilerplate text of a Title, enclosed by ‘’s.  For example,<br />suppose a Title has boilerplate text:<br /> <br />        Patient is a healthy PATIENT AGE year old male …<br /> <br />Then a user who enters such a note for a patient known by the system to be<br />56 years old would be presented with the text:<br /> <br />        Patient is a healthy 56 year old male …<br /> <br />The user can then add to the text and or edit the text, including the age<br />(56) of the patient.  From this point on, the patient age (56) is regular<br />text and is not updated in this note.<br /> <br />Objects must always have uppercase names, abbreviations, and print names.<br />When embedding objects in boilerplate text, users may embed any of these<br />three (name, abbreviation, print name) in boilerplate text, enclosed by<br />'’s.  Objects must always be embedded in uppercase.<br /> <br />Objects are stored in the Document Definition File, but are not part of<br />the Hierarchy.  They are accessible through the Option Create Objects.<br />(They are also accessible through the Option Sort Document Definitions, by<br />selecting Sort by Type and selecting Type Object.)<br /> <br />TIU exports a small library of objects.  Sites can also create their own.<br /> <br />Only an owner can edit an object and should do so only after consulting<br />with others who use it.  The object must be inactive for editing.  It<br />should be thoroughly tested.  See Object Status, under Status.<br /> <br />Entries of type Object cannot be changed to any other type.  Entries of<br />type Class, Document Class, Title, or Component cannot be changed to type<br />Object.<br /> <br />Type is a BASIC field.</td>

The Document Definition<br />Utility TIUF further limits Statuses to those appropriate for the entry<br />Type (see below), limits the Status of entries with Inactive ancestors to<br />Inactive, and limits the Status of faulty entries to Inactive.<br /> <br />Status applies to all Document Definitions, but its meaning and possible<br />values vary somewhat with the Document Definition Type.  Exception: Shared<br />Components: See COMPONENT STATUS, below.<br /> <br />Status is a BASIC field.<br /> <br />                                TITLE STATUS<br /> <br />Status has its most basic meaning for Titles [Document Definitions of Type<br />Title]:<br /> <br />A Title can have Status Inactive, Test, or Active.  If it has Status<br />Inactive, it cannot be used to enter documents (EXCEPT through the<br />Try Action, which deletes the document when done). If it has Status<br />Test, it can be used to enter documents only by its Owner. Titles should<br />be tested (and Tried) using TEST PATIENTS ONLY.  If a Title has Status<br />Active, it can be used to enter documents by any one with access and<br />authorization.  <br /> <br />                              <strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>* <br />NOTE on Availability of Titles for entering documents: <br />Although Status affects availability for entering documents, there are<br />other factors which also affect availability: A Document Definition is not<br />available to a given user for entering documents (excepting the Document<br />Definition Utility Try Action) unless all of the following 3 criteria are<br />met:<br /> <br />  1) It is a Document Definition of Type Title.<br /> <br />  2) It has Status Active or Test.  If it has Status Test, the user<br />entering a document must own the Title.<br /> <br />  3) If authorization for using the Title to enter documents is restricted<br />by Business Rules, the user must be a member of the authorized user<br />class.<br /> <br />Unless these criteria are all met, users trying to enter documents will<br />not SEE the Document Definition.  Therefore it is wise to warn users when<br />taking definitions offline for edit, and/or to do so at nonpeak hours for<br />entering documents.<br /> <br />The above description applies to document entry BOTH manually through<br />menu options AND via upload.  It does NOT apply to autoentry of documents<br />via the TIU application interface.  Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes entered<br />by the Allergy package are an example of such autoentry.  The TIU<br />application interface for autoentering documents disregards Title status<br />and Business Rules.<br />                             **</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***<br /> <br />When being upgraded to Status Active or Test, a Title is examined for<br />rudimentary completeness and must be judged OK before the upgrade takes<br />place.  If desired, users can perform the same examination themselves by<br />selecting action TRY.  For Titles, Action TRY also permits the user to<br />enter a document on the entry.  The document is deleted immediately after<br />the trial.<br /> <br />Availability for entering documents is the central meaning of Status.<br />However, Status also controls edit/deletion of Document Definitions:  A<br />Title can be edited ONLY if it has Status Inactive, ensuring that no one<br />is using it to enter a document while its behavior is changing.  Titles<br />can be deleted only with Status Inactive.<br /> <br />NOTE: Although Status affects Editing ability, it is not the only factor<br />affecting editing:  If an entry is already IN USE by documents,<br />editing/deletion is restricted to aspects which will not harm existing<br />TIU documents.<br /> <br />Components under a Title have the same status as the Title: When a Title’s<br />status is changed, the statuses of its descendant Components are<br />automatically changed with it. (Shared Components are an exception: see<br />COMPONENT STATUS, below.)<br /> <br />                       CLASS/DOCUMENT CLASS STATUS<br /> <br />A Document Definition of Type Class or Document Class can have Status<br />Inactive or Active.  <br /> <br />Basics for a Class or Document Class cannot be edited (except for Owner<br />and Status) unless it is Inactive.  Since Inactivating a Class/Document<br />Class automatically inactivates its descendants, this ensures that all<br />Titles which inherit behavior from it are neither Active nor Test, and are<br />thus ‘Offline’ while inherited behavior is edited.<br /> <br />In contrast to Basics, the ability to add/edit ITEMS of a Class/Document<br />Class depends on the Status of the item, not the parent: it is NOT<br />necessary to Inactivate a Class such as Progress Notes in order to<br />edit/add items.<br /> <br />Activating a Class/Document Class differs from Inactivating the<br />Class/Document Class: When a Class/Document Class is ACTIVATED, its<br />descendants may have any Status which their Type permits: they are not<br />REQUIRED to be Active. Hence, they are not automatically Activated when<br />the parent is Activated.<br /> <br />                            COMPONENT STATUS<br /> <br />A Document Definition of Type Component has the same status as its parent:<br />Its status can be changed only by changing the Status of its Parent, if it<br />has one. Components without parents are always Inactive.<br /> <br />NOTE: The above implies that Test or Active Titles cannot have Inactive<br />Components.  In other words, Inactivating a Component is NOT a way of<br />retiring it.  If a Component is no longer a useful section of a Title, it<br />should be edited so as to make it useful, or it should be deleted AS AN<br />ITEM from the Title of which it is a part.  As with all retired Document<br />Definitions, it should NOT be deleted FROM THE FILE if it has been used by<br />documents.<br /> <br />Components can be edited only if they have status Inactive. This ensures<br />that all Titles using them are offline while the components are being<br />edited.<br /> <br />Shared Components are a special case since they can have multiple parents.<br />They DO NOT HAVE A STATUS. They can be edited only when all parent Titles<br />have Status Inactive.  (The Detailed Display screen shows parents.)  This<br />ensures that all parent Titles of Shared Components are offline while the<br />component is being edited.  Edit of Shared Components is permitted only<br />through the Option Sort Document Definitions.<br /> <br />Edit of Shared Components is severely restricted by Ownership, since they<br />may be used multiple times and across the site.  Even an Inactive Status<br />does not permit a manager (person with Manager menu) to override ownership<br />and edit a Shared Component they don’t own.  See Shared Components, under<br />Description of Type.  See Description of Shared.<br /> <br />                               OBJECT STATUS<br /> <br />Document Definitions of Type Object have Status Inactive or Active.<br /> <br />Only ACTIVE objects function.  That is, if a user enters a document on a<br />Title with boilerplate text containing an inactive object, the object<br />doesn’t do anything; the user sees the name of the object and an error<br />message in place of the object data.<br /> <br />Only ACTIVE objects should be embedded in boilerplate text.  Exception:<br />owners who are creating/editing objects.  Others should NOT embed inactive<br />objects in boilerplate text since they may not be ready for use and since<br />they do not function when users enter documents against them. Titles whose<br />boilerplate text contains inactive objects cannot be activated.  (This<br />does NOT imply that active titles never have inactive objects embedded in<br />them since users can, after a warning, inactivate objects even when they<br />are embedded in active titles.)<br /> <br />Only INACTIVE objects can be edited (and only by an owner).  Only an owner<br />can activate/inactivate an object.  (Exception: if a user owns an object<br />and edits the owner to someone else, the user is not prevented from going<br />on to edit the status in the same edit session since they WERE the owner a<br />few seconds ago.)  Active objects are assumed to be ready for use in any<br />boilerplate text.<br /> <br />Since the owner is essentially caretaker of the object for the entire<br />site, the owner should consult with all who use it before editing it.

The<br />first case concerns Titles.  Sites can edit Status and Abbreviation for<br />National Titles.  Status INACTIVE for a National Title prevents manual and<br />upload entry of documents for the Title, while continuing to permit<br />automatic entry for the Title via the TIU application interface for new<br />notes.

For Class Progress Notes, Field Print Form Header holds the<br />header ‘Progress Notes’, Field Print Form Number holds Form Number ‘Vice<br />SF 509’, and Field Print Group holds ‘2’.
