# CloudVISTA (nodeVISTA)

nodeVISTA is a pure web-based, cloud-native, Node.js-driven version of VISTA (no MUMPS) and runs on a Node.js web server in the cloud. The following describes how to install and run the nodeVISTA demo to exercise the Master VISTA Data Model (MVDM). 

__This demonstration focuses on how MVDM audits, secures, and emulates current production VISTA clients such as CPRS using the RPC Emulator__:

# Installation
1. [Install nodeVISTA](#nodevista)
2. [Install CPRS](#cprs)

## nodeVISTA (cloudVISTA)
The **nodeVISTA** system provides the core MVDM Emulation services required for this demo. **nodeVISTA** typically runs within the context of a virtual host, managed by Vagrant.

The following describes how to install **nodeVISTA** server in a VirtualBox virtual machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Terminal emulator**: This varies depending on your operating system:
    * *MacOS*: Use the default [Terminal](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/) or download [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com)
    * *Linux*: Use the default [Terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) or download [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
    * *Windows*: Use the default [Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) or download [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads?replytocom=98578) and Extension Pack.
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

* Verify that Git, Virtualbox, and Vagrant are installed properly and are the latest version:
    ```shell
    $ git --version
    $ VBoxManage --version
    $ vagrant --version
    ```

### Installation

1. Install the `vagrant-timezone` Vagrant plugin by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt:
    ```shell
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-timezone
    ```

2. Clone the **nodeVISTA** repository: [https://github.com/vistadataproject/nodeVISTA](https://github.com/vistadataproject/nodeVISTA) by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt:
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/vistadataproject/nodeVISTA
    ```

3. `cd` to the `nodeVISTA/setup/` directory in a terminal or command prompt:

4. If you have installed a **nodeVISTA** VM beforehand, clear out your current VM and setup by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt:
   ```shell
   $ vagrant destroy --force
   ```

5. Create and configure the **nodeVISTA** VM by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt:
    ```shell
    $ vagrant up
    ```

6. The initial `vagrant up` process will download a pre-built **nodeVISTA** Vagrant VM. The VM is ~2.6 GB in size and may take awhile to initially download, depending on your network connection speed. If during this initial download the connection is interrupted,the  directory will need to be deleted and the process started again.  The process caches the pre-built VM, and subsequent deployments will not take as long.  Note:  On MacOS, VirtualBox VMs are stored under `/Users/{user}/VirtualBox VMs/`.

### Verify Installation

1. Start the **nodeVISTA** VM by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt:
    ```shell
    $ vagrant reload
    ```

2. Open the VISTA Data Model Browser (Fileman Schema Browser) by navigating your browser to [http://10.2.2.100:9000/schema](http://10.2.2.100:9000/schema).   One should be able to browse the entire VA VISTA Data Model:

## CPRS

The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is the graphical user interface (Client) through which physicians interact with VISTA (Server).  Because end-users don't ever "see" VISTA, __most users think that CPRS *is* the EHR (i.e. "CPRS is VISTA")__. In this regard, according to the most recent national survey of over 15,000 physician end-users of EHRs ( [Medscape 2016 National EHR Survey](http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/public/ehr2016#page=8) ), CPRS remains one of the highest regarded integrated EHR in the U.S.

### Prerequisites

__CPRS runs on all currently supported versions of Microsoft Windows__.  If one wishes to run CPRS on MacOS or LinuxOS, one first needs to create a virtual Windows environment by downloading the free open-source [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) or commercial [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) hypervisor, and then install the free  [Windows 10 image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) within this hypervisor. Alternately, Microsoft offers free pre-built, virtualized versions of Windows prepackaged for several different hypervisors, which one can download [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/#downloads).  Note all the free versions of Windows above have some restrictions, but nothing that affects the installation or execution of CPRS.

### Installation

1. From your Windows-based workstation (physical or virtual), download, unzip, and run the OSEHRA CPRS installer: [CPRS_Demo_0613.zip](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/raw/master/cprs/osehra/v69/CPRS_Demo_0613.zip)

2. Download the latest version of VA's CPRS binary: [CPRSChart30v75.zip (v1.0.30.75)](https://demoservices.vistadataproject.info/archive/CPRSChart30v75.zip).

3. Unzip `CPRSChart30v75.zip` and rename the `CPRSChart30v75.exe` uncompressed binary file to `CPRSChart.exe`.

4. Overwrite `C:\Program Files (x86)\VistA\CPRS\CPRSChart.exe` with the latest binary (v1.0.30.75).

5. Download the latest CommonFiles DLLs: [CPRS30v72_dll.zip](https://demoservices.vistadataproject.info/archive/CPRS30v72_dll.zip).

6. Unzip `CPRS30v72_dll.zip` and copy/overwrite the contents of the `CPRS30v72_dll/` folder to `C:\Program Files (x86)\VistA\Common Files`.

7. Copy the OSEHRA VistA shortcut to the Windows desktop and rename it to something like "RPC Server", etc.

8. Right click on the new desktop shortcut ("RPC Server") and select "Properties".

9. Modify the shortcut `Target` field with the following line:
    ```
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\VistA\CPRS\CPRSChart.exe" CCOW=disable s=10.2.2.100 p=9010 showrpcs
    ```

10. Start CPRS by double-clicking the "RPC Server" desktop shortcut.

Back at CPRS, select 'OK' and you will be brought to the (empty) patient chart

![CPRS Patient Chart -width70](/demo/images/common/cprs/patient-chart.png)

and the **nodeVISTA Manager** shows the extra RPCs invoked - the total is now at 133...
