# Introduction

## What is CPRS?
The Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0 (CPRS) is a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) computer application. CPRS enables you to enter, review, and continuously update all information connected with any patient. With CPRS, you can order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests and procedures, record a patient’s allergies or adverse reactions to medications, request and track consults, enter progress notes, diagnoses, and treatments for each encounter, and enter discharge summaries.

CPRS not only allows you to keep comprehensive patient records, it enables you to review and analyze the data gathered on any patient in a way that directly supports clinical decision-making.

CPRS documentation is also available on the  Intranet. The Intranet version will be constantly updated, and thus might contain more current information than this print version.
Intranet address: vista.med.va.gov/cprs/

First time VISTA users
If you are unfamiliar with this package or other Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (*VISTA*) software applications, we recommend that you study the *User’s Guide to Computing.* This orientation guide is a comprehensive handbook for first-time users of any *VISTA* application to help you become familiar with basic computer terms and the components of a computer. It is reproduced and distributed periodically by the Kernel Development Group. To request a copy, contact your local Information Resources Management Service (IRMS) staff.

## Conventions in This Manual
**Option examples:** Menus and examples of computer dialogue that you see on the screen are shown in courier font in boxes:***********User responses:** User responses are shown here in **bold**, but do not appear bold on the screen. The bold part of the entry is the letter or letters that must be typed so that the computer can identify the response. In most cases, you need only enter the first few letters. This increases speed and accuracy.********NOTE:** Names and social security numbers used in the examples are fictitious.********\<Enter\>** This indicates the Enter or Return key, which is pressed after every response you enter or when you wish to bypass a prompt, accept a default (//), or return to a previous action. In this manual, it is only shown in examples when it might be unclear that such a keystroke must be entered.********\^, \^\^, \^\^\^** Enter the Up-arrow (also known as a caret or circumflex) at a prompt to leave the current option, menu, sequence of prompts, or help. To get completely out of your current context and back to your original menu, you may need to enter two or three up-arrows. (You may see a message, “Press RETURN to continue or \^ or \^\^ to exit:” after each screen in a series of screen displays; e.g., for reports or online help.)********?, ??, ???** Enter one, two, or three question marks at a prompt for help about the menu, option, or prompt you are at. One question mark elicits a brief statement of what information is appropriate for responding to the prompt; two question marks show a list (and sometimes descriptions) of more actions; and three question marks provide more detailed help, including a list of possible answers, if appropriate.********Defaults (//)** Defaults are responses provided to speed up your entry process. They are either the most common responses, the safest responses, or the previous response.*****Example:** Select Action: Quit//

****Replace..With** If the default entry is longer than 20 characters, you will see the “Replace. With”***editor instead of the double slashes (//).***1.  Enter @ after Replace if you want to replace the entire default entry, **or*****1.  type one or two letters followed by three dots ( ) to change part of the letters***(e.g., to correct a misspelling),***1.  press Return,***1.  When the word With appears, type the correct name********Example***:*Provider: Clinical Coordinator Replace **Co...** With **Nurse**********\>\>** Side-arrows (Greater-than/Less-than; shift-comma, shift,period) indicate that more information is available on the right side of the screen. Enter these arrows at any prompt. If the arrows appear in front of an order, it means that the order requires action by a clerk or nurse.********+**, **-** The plus symbol at the bottom left-hand side of a screen of information indicates that more than one screen of information exists. Use the plus and minus keys to navigate up and down. If the + is displayed in front of a lab order, it means that the lab test will be done multiple times, according to a selected schedule.********Shortcut** You can jump through a sequence of actions and screens by entering the names (or their abbreviations) separated by semi-colons.*****Shortcut Example:** CC;O;AD;L will take you through Chart Contents, Orders, Add Orders, and to Lab.********Icons**![Key icon](media/ec7399fe4dec8ce0955bc54175c1f93f.png)s***\+ Indicates important information that the user should take note of.

## Notifications
Notifications are important messages that alert providers to certain clinical events (for example, a critical lab value). Some notifications are for information only; others allow you to take follow-up action to the event that triggered the notification. They may also notify providers of conditions such as unsigned orders. Notifications are automatically deleted after being displayed or when a follow-up action is taken.******Notifications are retained for a predetermined amount of time (up to 30 days), after which they may be sent to another destination, such as your MailMan surrogate or your supervisor. Confer with your CAC to establish and set up these options. You can also confer with your CAC to select what types of notifications you will receive. Some notifications are mandatory, however, and cannot be disabled. See the Personal Preferences section in this manual for further information about notifications.*********## CPRS and the List Manager User InterfaceCPRS was built to run in both the Windows operating environment (usually referred to simply as Windows) and on terminals. The Windows version of CPRS is described in another manual. This manual describes the terminal, text-based version of CPRS.***If you are not already familiar with List Manager applications, this section will take you on a quick tour of the interface. If you are already familiar with the List Manager interface, you can skip to the next section, **Using CPRS**.***List Manager is designed to display a list of clinical items (based on criteria you set) that you perform various actions on. An example of a CPRS screen in List Manager format is shown here, with explanations of the various components on the screen.
************************

## List Manager Conventions
List Manager is a tool designed so that a list of items can be presented to the user to perform *actions* on.![List Manager tool with sections listed](media/b314365539f68c8b20c1cca3e6923ffa.png)

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Screen title   | The screen title changes according to what type of information List Manager is displaying (e.g., Chart Contents, Cover Sheet, Active Orders, Lab Orders, etc.). Use this title as an identifier to confirm your location at any time.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Header area    | The header area is a “fixed” (non-scrollable) area that displays patient information. It also tells if there is more than one page of information and which page you’re currently on (e.g., Page: 1 of 3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| List area      | (scrolling region) This area scrolls and displays the information that you can take action on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Message window | This section displays a plus (+) sign, minus (-) sign, \>\> symbols, or informational text (i.e., Enter ?? for more actions). A plus sign means more information is available; enter it at the action prompt to “jump” forward a page; a minus sign “jumps” back a screen.; \> moves you to more information on the right; and \< moves you back to the left or main screen. Other allowable actions may be displayed in the message window. |
| Action area    | A list of actions display in this area of the screen. If you enter double question marks (??) at the “Select Action(s)” prompt, you are shown a “hidden” list of additional actions that are available to you.   




## Entering CPRS
You can take several routes to get into CPRS to enter orders and progress notes, review them, and display reports and results for individual patients. The route you choose depends on how your site has set up your menus, what your primary purpose is, and what seems most convenient to you.***-   The **CPRS Clinician Menu** on the main Clinician’s Menu.***-   One of the following menus or options on the Clinician’s Menu***-   Add New Orders***-   Act on Existing Orders***-   Results Reporting***This Guide describes going through the CPRS Clinician Menu, which provides a multi-faceted view of a patient’s medical record.******When you enter the CPRS Clinician Menu, you will see this screen:***![CPRS Clinician Menu](media/97259670e65c6f316674972c864a78a1.png)

## Selecting a Patient
The Patient Selection screen offers three methods for finding your patient:******-   Entering a name from a list (if you have one defined and set as your default,***-   Entering a patient’s name (or last initial + last 4 letters of SSN) at the Select Patient prompt, or***-   Entering FD (Find Patient), entering a ward or clinic name, then selecting a patient name from the list that appears.
******The Cover Sheet of the selected patient chart displays the patient’s name, SSN, date of birth, age, unit/location, allergies/adverse reactions, patient postings, vitals, immunizations, and service connection.******###### NOTES:-   **You may only have one patient chart open at any given time*****-   **Two users may not simultaneously take actions on orders for the same patient**![Cover Sheet with CWAD (Cautions, Warnings, Allergies, or Directives) label highlighted](media/6f61dc244bf0a709ccca783d63c270a6.png)*********## ActionsEnter the display numbers of the items you wish to change or act on. A menu of available actions is then presented for selection. You can also choose the action first and then the item.***-   Enter NW to document a new allergy.***-   Enter AD to add new orders for this patient from any page in the chart.***-   Enter CC to see a list of the other “pages” of the chart.***-   Enter SP to select a different patient.***-   Enter ?? to see a list of other actions available.
******## More Actions***When you enter two question marks (??) at the prompt, the following (hidden) actions are displayed. They can also be used at any prompt.*********## Alerts, Allergies, and Patient Postings***You can access some patient information directly from the Cover Sheet, without going to other tabs.******-   Allergies***-   Patient Postings***-   Recent Vitals***-   Immunizations***-   Eligibility***-   ***From this screen, you can view a detailed display of any of these items, or you can record new allergies.***![Cover Sheet showing alerts, allergies, and patient postings](media/63246ee3fad463ba17c88af8a89eb9f6.png)***********************Allergies/Alerts Detailed Display**![Allergies/Alerts Detailed Display](media/2f40b113a59136e760a6671cc7b6d0d2.png)

# Chart ContentsThe Patient Chart is composed of screens that represent the pages of a traditional paper patient chart. The Chart Contents screen provides easy, logical access to other screens that show specialized patient information.******


| Cover Sheet | Orders | Imaging       | Reports |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Problems    | Meds   | Consults      |         |
| Notes       | Labs   | D/C Summaries |         |

When you choose most of these, the first thing you see is a list of current items for this patient (active problems, progress notes, lab results, orders, or meds). You can then review any of the items in greater detail, edit or cancel them if appropriate, or order new ones.**HINT**: To quickly jump through a series of screens, enter the names or abbreviations of the actions, separated by semi-colons. Example: CC;Orders;Meds.***![Patient Chart Cover Sheet](media/8a47bdccd8195c5a0e48cd63e0b212cd.png)

# Problems
The Problems tab is used to document and track a patient’s health care problems. It provides you with a current and historical view of the patient’s problems across clinical specialties and it allows you to trace each identified problem through the *VISTA* system in terms of treatment, test results, and outcome. To go to the Problems screen, select the Problems tab at the bottom of the Chart Contents screen.******In the Problems tab, you can change the display to see customized lists of problems, edit a problem to reflect changes, and add a new problem.**To enter the Problems screen:*****1.

You can print a copy of all current orders that would appear on a patient’s chart, using a pre-defined format. **Each hospital can only** **have one format for Chart Copies.** |
*****Add New Orders*****The *Add New Orders* action leads to the Add Orders screen. The Add Orders screen varies widely from user to user, based on how your local coordinators have set it up to best fit your needs. You can order from many services, by individual order, by several selections separated by commas, or by a range of numbers separated by a hyphen. After completing one order, you proceed automatically to the next.******When you have finished placing orders, enter Q. You will then be prompted to sign these new orders. When the order(s) are signed, service copies print to the appropriate area(s) for action. Chart copies may print at the nurses’ station/patient location.******Items with ellipses (…) after them bring up menus of available items within that category. Other orders are “quick orders.” These are commonly ordered items that have been set up with pre-defined defaults, reducing the number of prompts.********Add Orders Screen Example**![Add Orders Screen example](media/04c6da6c8e2d77896a78d0de92eaa2f2.png)*****Set Delay**An event-delayed order is an order that is executed only after a predefined event (known as a release event) occurs. A release event can be an event such as an admission, discharge, or transfer. For example, you could write an event-delayed diet order that would not execute until a patient is transferred to a specific ward.******A CAC defines the release events at your site. (For more information on defining release events, see Appendix G of the *CPRS List Manager Technical Manual* or the Event- Delayed Orders topic in the *CPRS GUI Technical Manual*). Once a CAC has defined a release event, you can write an order that will not execute until that release event occurs.

They **print only at the patient’s ward/ location, and are not transmitted electronically to other Services for completion**.

Examples of these various kinds of nursing orders are:

| **Order type** | **Order**                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Parameters     | vital signs                               |
| Activity       | bed rest, ambulate, up in chair           |
| Patient Care   | skin and wound care, drains, hemodynamics |
| Free text      | immunizations                             |

Pre-defined nursing orders (quick orders) may be available under various sub-menus. Nursing orders may also be composed by selecting the Text Only option from the Order Screen. These orders require the ward staff to take action to complete the request.

## Overview of New CPRS/POE Functionality
To make it easier for providers to enter medication orders and have fewer orders that needed to be changed by pharmacy and sent back for provider signature, the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancement (POE) project was undertaken. The aim of this project was to make it easier for clinicians to enter medication orders and have the computer do the work in the background to also get pharmacists the information they need to fill the orders appropriately.******In doing this, the ORDER DIALOG file was changed to alter how CPRS prompts clinicians for the information needed in a way that is more natural for them and will hopefully reduce the number of orders that need to be edited and sent back for signature again. Changes include removing the Dispense drug prompt and instead request a dose, using an API to ensure that the VA policy that a provider ordering a controlled substance must have a DEA or VA number, autocalculation of the quantity if a common dispense drug and a standard schedule are entered, and the availability of standard schedules to name a few.******For the List Manager interface, the changes will be seen in the dialogs that you normally use. In addition, another Medications item called Medications may have been added to your ordering menu. The Medications item can be used in addition to the existing dialogs for INPATIENT MEDS, OUTPATIENT MEDS, and IV FLUIDS. The only difference between this new dialog and the Inpatient and Outpatient dialogs is that Medications will automatically assign the ordering context (Inpatient vs. Outpatient) based on the selected patient's current admission/visit status. The Medications item provides a single dialog for medication orders instead of forcing the provider to pick among the INPATIENT MEDS, OUTPATIENT MEDS, and IV FLUIDS order dialogs. If the provider wants to use those specific dialogs, they are still available.*****Note:** With the new Medications item, the provider will not be able to write a prescription if the patient is currently admitted, or order an inpatient IV med for a patient in an outpatient clinic (i.e. you won’t be able to write an order for the opposite context).***Therefore, the old INPATIENT MEDS, OUTPATIENT MEDS, and IV FLUIDS items should still be available for the provider to use.******There are several other changes that are explained in the POE Release Notes.

## Ordering Outpatient Medications with a Simple Dose***1.  
Select Medications or your normal outpatient medications menu item from your Add Order Screen (AD).***1.  Type in the medication name.***1.  Select the medication formulation.*****Note:** CPRS now uses a look up from Pharmacy to check if the selected medication is a controlled substance that will require the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number or a Schedule II (i.e., narcotics) drug that requires a wet signature (rather than an electronic one). **For controlled substances**, CPRS displays the message “Provider must have DEA\# or VA\# to order this drug!” Before an order for a controlled substance can be entered, the provider selected for the encounter must be able to sign the order. You may need to exit the dialog, change the provider, and then reenter the dialog. **For a Schedule II** (i.e., narcotics), the message is “This order will require a wet signature!”***Non-formulary medications are identified by the words “non-formulary” in parenthesis to the right of the medication. For example, you might see******ASPIRIN SUPP,RTL (non-formulary)******if you type in aspirin as the medication.******1.  For a simple dose, type **N** and press \<**Enter**\>.***1.  Select the dose, if one is displayed, or enter a dose.***1.  Enter Route. (Automatically defaults to the common route for this drug).***1.  Enter a Schedule.***A message may display indicating what the normal fill for the selected medication is.******1.  Enter a Days Supply. (The default fill is usually displayed.)***1.

| Division/System value is Mandatory | Either the site or the CPRS package determined that a notification is mandatory for either a division or a hospital. |   |   |                 |   |
| OERR value is Mandatory            | The notification is exported as mandatory.                                                                           |   |   |                 |   |

When the program asks if you want to add a new Notification, logically you’d want to say “No,” but the program is really asking if you want to add a new notification to a temporary list for consideration about enabling or disabling. The program is using a generic FileMan call⎯we hope that in the near future a more user- friendly utility will be written for this option.

***********************###### ACTIONSActions (also known as protocols) are the items listed on the bottom part of the list manager screens. Sometimes these are processes that you can perform on screen items (processes such as sign, print, discontinue, renew, etc.), and sometimes they are the names of other screens (chart tabs) that you can go to.*****NOTE:** Order actions in CPRS work differently from OE/RR. In CPRS, you must pick an order from the review screen before the available actions appear at the bottom of the screen. In OE/RR the actions were visible at the bottom of the review screen before you selected an order.******###### CHART TABSChart Tabs are another name for the Chart Contents actions or pages. They allow you the following choices: Orders, Notes, Meds, Lab, D/C Summaries, and Problem Lists. (They are called Tabs to be consistent with the GUI version of CPRS, which uses the Windows convention of having tab-like graphic images for selecting options.) If you select one of these tabs, you will be given the option of NW. This allows you to write new notes, meds, labs, and problems without going through the order screen. You may also view results relating to these tabs by using the following steps: (1) Select CC; (2) Select a tab; e.g., consults, lab, (3) Select the number of the item you want information on, (4) Select Detailed Display.******###### CONSULTSConsults may be ordered via CPRS by selecting Other from the Add Orders screen or by selecting the Consults tab. You can also see Consults results through CPRS.******###### DETAILED DISPLAYWhen you select the action Detailed Display (DD) you can see additional information about an order, including *Who* entered the order, *what* physician or nurse initiated the order, and the *date* the order was entered or discontinued. You may view this information by selecting the number of the order in question, and then choosing Detailed Display .******###### ELECTRONIC SIGNATUREAn Electronic signature must accompany all orders entered by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant. These orders are not released to the services until signed (except for verbal orders). For outpatient medications, the order must be signed by an authorized provider. Verbal, telephoned, and written orders cannot be released to the pharmacy until they are signed.*****Note:** The purpose of this is to comply with VHA policy. You can read the policy on the intranet at [http://vaww.va.gov/pub/direc/health/manual/020704.htm.](http://vaww.va.gov/pub/direc/health/manual/020704.htm)******###### EXPIRED MED ORDERSExpired Med orders remain on the order screen for a time designated by your site.
********Helpful Hints, cont’d*****###### \>\> INDICATORSThe “greater-than” symbols (**\>\>**) beside an order indicates that this order needs to be completed or have action taken by a nurse or ward clerk.***When \>\> is shown in the black bar of the List Manager screen, it means that more information is available to the right of the screen; enter one or more of these symbols to see this information.******###### INORDERABLE ITEM IN PHARMACYThis is a notation that is seen when the pharmacy has changed its dispense drugs. An inorderable item can’t be renewed. The med in question can be continued by choosing the Change option, which automatically DCs the original and creates a new order that will be renewable thereafter. The Change option takes you through each field of the medication and allows you to edit as needed.******###### LAB TIP***To change a lab urgency “on-the-fly”: When you select a quick order from the menu, enter the number of the item followed by =\*.******###### MEDICATION ENTRY TIPS1.  Always use upper case when entering the schedule. The approved abbreviation for hours is***H. If other letters are listed, such as hr or hrs, the pharmacy package doesn’t read the schedule accurately, and incorrect times will appear on your MARS. Currently administration times can be edited under the Unit Dose option only.***1.  Enter the Schedules for these orders as follows: Insulin BID BID-INSULIN***ISMO BID-ISMO***PRN Q4-6H PRN***1.  Multiple Meds may be renewed or discontinued by selecting the order numbers, pressing enter, and choosing Renew or DC.***1.  Hard copies of orders automatically print to the service(s).***1.  Meds for discharge or pass can be selected and converted to outpatient status. This prevents the need for carbon copies of orders with original signatures. To place Meds on hold, enter a free-text order. Pharmacy considers orders to be either active or discontinued. They do not act on Hold orders. This is an action taken only by a unit’s nursing staff.***1.  If an order is questioned by pharmacy, it will be flagged, stating the reason for the flag, and the physician receives a View Alert. A Med can be unflagged if you choose the Med in question and then select UNFLAG.***1.  Verbal orders cause a View Alert to be automatically generated for the physician who needs to electronically sign the order.
*****Helpful Hints, cont’d*****###### NOTESProgress Notes can be accessed directly from the patient’s chart or through TIU as a separate menu option.******###### PATIENT LISTSYou can set up a specific list as your default. To enter a list, choose CHANGE VIEW (CV), then select WARD, CLINIC, or PROVIDER, etc., enter the name of the group (e.g., 2 west), then choose SV to save the list. This list must be saved after its selection for it to become your default. To change from one chart to another, the SP (Select Patient) choice returns the screen to your default list where you can select another patient. You may also enter a patient from another area of the unit by choosing FD (Find Patient) and entering the patient’s name. FD can be used even if you already have another unit loaded as your default list.******###### QUICK ORDERSQuick Orders allow you to enter labs and meds without going through as many steps. They are selected from the AD order screen by simply selecting a number (other than the \#s for the categories LABORATORY, MEDICATIONS, IMAGING, DIETETICS, etc.). Quick Orders are ones that physicians have determined to be their most commonly ordered items and have standard collection times, routes, and other conditions.******###### REPORTSReports for individual patients are available from the Reports tab. Reports for a ward/clinic can be found under the Results Reporting menu option. To print a Ward Summary, follow these steps:***1.  Select Results Reporting***1.  Select patient or patients***1.  Enter the range of numbers you want***1.  Choose \#8 to print Daily Order Summary, or \#11 for Chart Copies of orders***1.  Enter date range***1.  Answer Yes to *Display only those orders placed on this day: NO//****1.  Enter a printer name or hit ENTER at the DEVICE: HOME// prompt (This can also be queued)
******************# Glossary\+ A plus sign (+) in front of a Progress Note indicates that the note has addenda. A + in front of a lab order indicates that this lab test will be done multiple times according to a selected schedule.******\>\> These arrows (displayed in the center black bar) indicate that more information can be seen by scrolling to the left. If they are displayed beside an order, it means that a nurse or clerk needs to take action on the order.******CPRS Computerized Patient Record System, the *VISTA* package (in both GUI and character-based formats) that provides access to most components of the patient chart.******ASU Authorization/Subscription Utility, a *VISTA* application (initially released with TIU) that allows VAMCs to assign privileges such as who can do what in ordering, signing, releasing orders, etc.******Chart Contents The various components of the Patient Record, equivalent to the***major categories of a paper record; for example, Problem List, Progress Notes, Orders, Labs, Meds, Reports, etc. In CPRS, these components are listed at the bottom of the screen, to be selected individually for performing actions.******Consults Consult/Request Tracking, a *VISTA* product that is also part of CPRS (it can function as part of CPRS, independently as a standalone package, or as part of TIU). It’s used to request and track consultations or procedures from one clinician to another clinician or service.******Cover Sheet A screen of the CPRS patient chart that displays an overview of the patient’s record.******CWAD Crises, Warnings, Allergies/Adverse Reactions, and Directives.***These are displayed on the Cover Sheet of a patient’s computerized record, and can be edited, displayed in greater detail, or added to. *See Patient Postings.*******D/C Summary Discharge Summary; see below.******Discharge Summary A component of TIU that can function as part of CPRS, Discharge***Summaries are recapitulations of a patient’s course of care while in the hospital.******GUI Graphical User Interface—a Windows-like screen with pull-down menus, icons, pointer device, etc.******Health Summary A *VISTA* product that can be viewed through CPRS, Health***Summaries are components of patient information extracted from other *VISTA* applications.********Glossary, cont’d*****************Imaging A *VISTA* product that is also a component of CPRS; it includes Radiology, X-rays, Nuclear Medicine, etc.******Notifications Alerts regarding specific patients that appear on the CPRS patient***chart. They can be responded to through “VA View Alerts.”******OE/RR Order Entry/Results Reporting, a *VISTA* product that evolved into the more comprehensive CPRS.******Order Checking A component of CPRS that reviews orders as they are placed to see if they meet certain defined criteria that might cause the clinician placing the order to change or cancel the order (e.g., duplicate orders, drug-drug/diet/lab test interactions, etc.).******PCMM Patient Care Management Module, a *VISTA* product that manages patient/provider lists.******Patient Postings A component of CPRS that includes messages about patients; an***expanded version of CWAD (see above).******Progress Notes A component of TIU that can function as part of CPRS.******Quick Orders Quick Orders allow you to enter many kinds of orders without going through as many steps. They are types of orders that physicians have determined to be their most commonly ordered items and that have standard collection times, routes, and other conditions.******Reports A component of CPRS that includes Health Summary, Action Profile, and other summarized reports of patient care.******TIU Text Integration Utilities; a package for document handling, that includes Consults, Discharge Summary, and Progress Notes, and will later add other document types such as surgical pathology reports.***TIU components can be accessed for individual patients through the CPRS, or for multiple patients through the TIU interface.******VISN Veterans Information System Network, the regional organizations for managing computerization within a region.*******VISTA* Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture, the new name for DHCP.
