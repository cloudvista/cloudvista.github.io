## Introduction

### What is CPRS?

The Computerized Patient Record System v.1.0 (CPRS) is a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) computer application. CPRS enables you to enter, review, and continuously update all information connected with any patient. With CPRS, you can order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests and procedures, record a patient’s allergies or adverse reactions to medications, request and track consults, enter progress notes, diagnoses, and treatments for each encounter, and enter discharge summaries.
CPRS not only allows you to keep comprehensive patient records, it enables you to review and analyze the data gathered on any patient in a way that directly supports clinical decision-making.

**Note:** The CPRS Technical Manual is a companion to this manual and contains a wealth of information about setting up CPRS, files, and how order checking and notifications work to name just a few items. Sites should be familiar with and use both manuals.
#### World Wide Web

CPRS documentation is also available on the VistA Document Library (VDL) The online versions will be updated as needed. Please look for the latest version on the VDL:
<http://www.va.gov/vdl>
### CPRS GUI Interface

CPRS was built to run in both the Microsoft Windows operating environment (usually referred to simply as Windows) and on terminals. The terminal, text-based version of CPRS is not described in this manual. This manual describes the Windows version of CPRS. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of CPRS uses graphical elements, such as lines, boxes, and pictures, to display information instead of just text. Windows is another example of a GUI.
### The Organization of this Manual

This manual is organized in the way most people will see the CPRS GUI product. CPRS is patterned similar to the patient’s chart. The technical aspects of each tab in the chart are explained. The configuration of CPRS is controlled using the Parameter file. Several parameters affect the presentation of the chart by controlling defaults and allowing functionality to be enabled. Parameters are further listed in the appendix. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are also listed. An RPC is a procedure called from the client (the user’s workstation) communicating to the server (the M database).
## General Application Settings
The settings described in this section refer to those not generally tied to any tab in CPRS, but apply to the overall application. This section covers the following areas:
-   Command line switches
-   Initial View
-   Tools Menu
-   Window Layout
-   Timeouts
-   Miscellaneous
***

### Command Line Switches

CPRS supports several command line switches. The switches enable users define certain parameters, such as the name of the server or the port number. Others enable users to force certain behaviors in CPRS, such as debugging, showing which remote procedure calls are executing, forcing, limiting, or disabling context management, and turning off the CPRS splash screen.
The switches supported by CPRS are as follows:
SERVER= or S= name of server to connect to
PORT= or P= broker port on that server
DEBUG allow server-side debugging and breakpoints (see RPCBroker docs)
SHOWRPCS putting this on the command line enables the user to see the last 100 RPCs if by using the Last Broker Call option on the Help menu
CCOW= DISABLE - run in non-CCOW mode
FORCE - force second and subsequent instances of CPRS to link to context on startup
PATIENTONLY - limits context management to patient context only, not user context
SPLASH= OFF - do not show splash screen
***

**Note:** Although there are three CCOW command line switches, CPRS can only use one at a time. If users put more than one CCOW switch in the shortcut, CPRS will use only the first one.
***

These switches can be placed anywhere used to run CPRS, such as the Run window, a batch file, or in the Target field of a CPRS shortcut as shown in the graphic below:
![Shortcut tab displaying the Target filed and the location in VISTA.](media/e1ef6f79ec77683c7a5f638b2180c6cd.png)
This screen shot shows the Properties of a windows shortcut. In the Target field, command line switches defining the server and the port are shown.
***

### Initial View

The first tab that displays when a user starts CPRS may be set by the parameter ORCH INITIAL TAB. This parameter may be set for the site and then overridden at the division and user levels, as needed. If no value is set, the chart will open, by default, to the Cover Sheet. ORCH INITIAL TAB may be set to the following values:
-   1 Cover
-   2 Problems
-   3 Meds
-   4 Orders
-   6 Notes
-   7 Consults
-   8 DC Summ
-   9 Labs
-   10 Reports
**Note:** The number 5 is not one of the possible values. It is reserved.
***

Additionally, CPRS may be configured to remain on the same tab when the user changes to another patient record. Setting ORCH USE LAST TAB to “yes” will accomplish this. If ORCH USE LAST TAB is set to “no” or not set, the chart will always open to the tab identified by ORCH INITIAL TAB when changing patients.
### Women’s Health Features

CPRS has added support for Women’s Health features, including changes or additions to notifications, a new Women’s Health Notes Document Class, integration of Women’s Health quick orders and reminder dialogs, and reports.
### Tools Menu

A site may use the Tools menu to give users access to other client software from within CPRS. The parameter, ORWT TOOLS MENU, is used to set up the list of software that appears on the menu. This parameter may be set up for the site, then overridden as appropriate at the division, service, and user levels. Below, you will find instructions on the format for entering items on this list and the use of submenus.
#### Format for Entering Items in ORWT TOOLS MENU

Each item entered on the menu should have the form, NAME=COMMAND. NAME is the name you want the user to see on the menu. CPRS automatically assigns a letter in each item so that the user can select it using the keyboard. However, if you want to assign a specific letter for item, you can type an ampersand (&) in front of any letter to allow keyboard access to the menu item using that letter. In the example below, by entering the ampersand before the N in notepad, the user will see the item as Notepad on the menu. If the user had instead placed the ampersand before the “t”, the menu item would be Notepad. The COMMAND may be a line that can be executed by Windows. It may also be any file for which Windows has a file association.
*Example: Create a user’s tools menu that contains Notepad, access to the CPRS Web page, and a terminal session to the local site.*

***

Note that CPRSInfo did not require an executable file to be identified. Since Windows understands hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), it will launch the workstation’s default browser and navigate to the address. Also, note the quotation marks in the VistA Terminal example. A path that contains space characters (like C:\\Program Files\\...) must be surrounded by quotation marks. Entries on the command line may also contain parameters. In the example above, LOCALVAMC is the name of a KEA! session that is passed as a command line parameter.
It is possible to pass context-sensitive parameters. These are parameters that are entered as placeholders, and then converted to the appropriate values at runtime. These placeholder parameters are:
%SRV = Server name for the current broker connection.
%PORT = Port number for the current broker connection.
%MREF = M code giving the global reference where the patient DFN is stored.
%DFN = The actual DFN of the currently selected patient.
%DUZ = Internal entry number of the current user.
***

So, if you have another application that needs to know, for example, the identity of the current user and currently selected patient, you could list %DUZ and %DFN as parameters in the command that executes that program.
*Example: Add VistA Imaging as a fourth item on the Tools menu above. Pass it to the server and port used by CPRS, in addition to the global reference that contains the current patient identifier.*

#### Adding Items to the Tools Menu

To add an item to the Tools menu, you will need to know an appropriate sequence number to use. You can use the List Values option to see the sequence numbers of the items on the tools menu.
**To add an item to the Tools menu, use the following steps:**
1.  In the VistA roll and scroll interface, on the CPRS Manager Menu (ORMGR), type IR for the CPRS Configuration (IRM)… menu and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the General Parameter Tools… by typing XX and pressing \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the Edit Parameter Values options by typing EP and pressing \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Parameter Definition prompt, type ORWT TOOLS and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the level at which you want to set options for the Tools menu: System, Division, Service, Location, User and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Select Sequence prompt, type the sequence number that you have chosen. Remember to choose a number that is not in use unless you want to replace that item. The sequence number will also affect where the item will display in the list.
**Note:** If you do not know which sequence numbers are in use, type a question mark and press \<Enter\>. This will give you a listing with sequence number, name of the item, and what it represents. Then return to step 6.
1.  At the Are you adding *sequence number* as a new sequence?// prompt, type Y and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Sequence *sequence number* prompt, press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the NAME=COMMAND prompt, type the Name as you want it to display on the Tools menu followed by an equals sign (=) and then the item you want (it could be an executable, or a directory, or a web site) and then press \<Enter\>.
**Note:** Remember that executables or web sites with spaces will need quote marks around them. Also, for submenus, you will need a number of the menu. In addition, if you want to have a letter in the display name to be used for a short cut, you will need to put an ampersand (&) in front of the letter. See the examples in this section.
1.  Repeat steps 6 through 9 to add more items.
#### Removing an Item from the Tools Menu

To remove an item from the Tools Menu, you must know the sequence number of the item. You can find the sequence number using the List Values option. Check that you are using the right level.
**To add an item to the Tools menu, use the following steps:**
1.  In the VistA roll and scroll interface, on the CPRS Manager Menu (ORMGR), type IR for the CPRS Configuration (IRM)… menu and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the General Parameter Tools… by typing XX and pressing \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the Edit Parameter Values options by typing EP and pressing \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Parameter Definition prompt, type ORWT TOOLS and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the level at which you want to set options for the Tools menu: System, Division, Service, Location, User and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Select Sequence prompt, type the sequence number of the item you want to delete.
**Note:** If you do not know which sequence numbers are in use, type a question mark and press \<Enter\>. This will give you a listing with sequence number, name of the item, and what it represents. Then return to step 6.
1.  At the Sequence *sequence number* prompt, type @ press \<Enter\>.
1.  The item is then deleted.
1.  Repeat steps 5-7 should you wish to delete another item.
#### Automatic and User-Created Submenus

Previously, the ORWT TOOLS MENU enabled sites to place a maximum of 99 items on the tools menu, but with screen size, a lower number of items could be placed on the Tools menu before the menu would go off the screen. With the addition of submenus, the 99 items should now display on the screen.
##### Automatically Created More… Submenus

If CAC or IRM personnel make entries for over 30 items, CPRS automatically creates submenus so that the menus do not exceed 30 items per menu or submenu. When the number of items entered without manual submenus exceed 30 items, CPRS automatically creates a submenu labeled “More…”. Additional items entered with higher sequence numbers are then placed under the More submenu. If a user then adds more than 30 additional items (a total now of more than 60) another More… submenu is created from the first More… submenu.
###### User-Created Submenus

In addition, users can create their own submenus to help them organize the items on their Tools menu. To manually create submenus on the Tools menu, users must place special text in the name and command values. Submenus must have Command text SUBMENU *ID*, where *ID* is a unique identifier for the submenu. Menu items belonging to the submenu must specify which submenu they belong to by appending [*ID*] after the caption.
Thus, the following entries create a Utilities submenu with 2 child items that bring up Notepad and the Calculator:
Utilities=SUBMENU 1
Calculator[1]=calc.exe
Notepad[1]=notepad.exe

To create a nested submenu, you create a submenu that belongs to another submenu’s ID. For example, to create a nested submenu belonging the above Utilities submenu, you would do the following:
Utility Web Sites[2]=SUBMENU UtilWeb
Microsoft Tools[UtilWeb]=http:\\\\www.msdn.com
Submenu IDs at the end of a name are not displayed on the Tools menu—as long as a corresponding menu ID is found. If no Menu ID is found, the square brackets and included text will appear as part of the name on the Tools menu. This allows for existing bracketed text to remain displayed.
If two submenus share the same menu ID, the second submenu will be treated as belonging to the first menu.
Also, to create a divider, users can enter a name of a single dashes (hyphens or a single dash followed by a submenu id) to create a separator line in the menu or submenu. This is not new functionality, but may not have been previously documented.

Nested submenus can help CAC or IRM personnel organize items on the Tools menus for users.
#### Window Layout

When a user exits, the sizes and positions of major CPRS windows and controls are saved. The following parameters are used to store window settings:
**ORWCH BOUNDS** stores the left, top, width, and height pixel positions of a window, splitter, or display area (areas on the Meds tab). The internal window name is used to identify each instance of this parameter. For example, if user CPRSPROVIDER, TEN exits the main window in CPRS (frmFrame), a ORWCH BOUNDS parameter might be stored as:
1.  Entity: USR:CPRSPROVIDER,TEN
1.  Instance: frmFrame
1.  Value: 0, 10, 730, 500
***

This would indicate that the window was to the left (left=0), 10 pixels from the top (top=0), 730 pixels wide and 500 pixels high.
Deleting an entry will reset the associated window or dialog to its default values. A value of all zeros (0,0,0,0) indicates that the window or dialog is maximized to fill the screen.
The following table lists the internal names that are commonly used with this parameter.
| **Name**     | **Description**                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| pnlMedOut | Stores the left, top, width, and height pixel positions of the outpatient medications display. |
| pnlNonVA  | Stores the left, top, width, and height pixel positions of the Non-VA medications display.     |
**ORWCH WIDTH** stores the position of the splitter bar on most tabs. Usually the width of the left-most pane in the window is stored. Each instance is identified by the internal name of the window and control. A sample of this parameter could be:
1.  Entity: USR: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN
1.  Instance: frmNotes.pnlLeft
1.  Value: 169
This would indicate that when the user last exited CPRS, the splitter bar on the notes tab was placed such that the left side (the list of notes) was 169 pixels wide.
The following tables list the internal names that are often used with this parameter.
| **Name**            | **Description**                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| frmConsults.pnlLeft | Consults tab, left side (list of consults)                |
| frmDCSumm.pnlLeft   | Discharge Summary tab, left side (list of summaries)      |
| frmLabs.pnlLeft     | Labs tab, left side (selection of report)                 |
| frmNotes.pnlLeft    | Notes tab, left side (list of progress notes)             |
| frmOrders.pnlLeft   | Orders tab, left side (Order Sheets & Write Orders lists) |
| frmProblems.pnlLeft | Problems tab, left side (problem status & pick lists)     |
| frmReports.pnlLeft  | Reports tab, left side (list of reports)                  |
**ORWCH COLUMNS** stores the width of columns for grid displays such as the medication lists. The width of individual columns is listed in a comma-delimited string. FormName.HeaderName identifies each instance. A sample of this parameter might be:
1.  Entity: USR: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN
1.  Instance: frmMeds.hdrMedsIn
Value: 42,516,62,62
***

This would indicate that the column widths for the list of inpatient medications was last saved as Action = 42 pixels, Medication = 516 pixels, stop date = 62 pixels, and status = 62 pixels.
The following table lists the internal names that are often used with this parameter.
| **Name**            | **Description**                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| frmMeds.hdrMedsIn   | Meds tab, inpatient medications list  |
| frmMeds.hdrMedsOut  | Meds tab, outpatient medications list |
| frmOrders.hdrOrders | Orders tab, orders list               |
### Entering Time into CPRS Fields

CPRS generally allows users to enter time in several different formats. Users can often enter month-day-year dates (such as 05/01/65) or users can sometimes spell out the month (November 22, 2001) or as a date referenced from today (t-30 for a month in the past, today minus 30).
Users often can enter a time as well as a date. For tasks such as medication ordering and administration, entering a time can be critical. Times are entered as a 24-hour time, not with a 12-hour clock and an a.m. and p.m. For example, the time 8 a.m. is entered as 08:00:00, whereas 8 p.m. is entered as 20:00:00.
**Note:** The time 00:00 presents a challenge because it can be ambiguous as to when it is. To address this issue, CPRS changes the time of 00:00 to 00:01. This makes the time belong to a specific day, increasing clarity. Similarly, if a user selects Midnight, CPRS makes the time 23:59.
### Timeouts

Two parameters control the timeout behavior of the CPRS GUI.
-   **ORWOR TIMEOUT CHART** allows the CPRS GUI to have its own timeout, independent of DTIME. This is the number of seconds that CPRS should remain idle before timing out. This timeout applies only to the GUI version of CPRS and not to any other application. If it is not set, the value of DTIME is used.
-   **ORWOR TIMEOUT COUNTDOWN** is used to specify how long the warning window should appear before a user times out. It is possible that a user could timeout in CPRS while using another application on the workstation. So a warning window with a countdown is displayed to the user. The value is the number of seconds for the countdown before CPRS is closed.
### Miscellaneous

#### Event Notification

CPRS broadcasts messages to notify other applications about events within CPRS, such as when a patient changes.
ORWOR BROADCAST MESSAGES
#### Web Access

When this parameter is set to yes, web links in the CPRS GUI will be disabled or hidden.
ORWOR DISABLE WEB ACCESS.
## Personal Preferences (GUI)

Personal Preferences are edited in the GUI version of CPRS using the Tools \| Options menu. A user's configurations are primarily determined by settings in CPRS parameters in the Parameter file, while other defaults may use file settings or Kernel utilities. This outline shows which parameters are being used at the user level.

## Patient Selection Settings

### Patient List Settings

Patients can be selected by typing their name and then selecting the patient or by selecting the patient from lists. Algorithms protect against displaying sensitive or inappropriate data. Patient list settings can be controlled through the List Manager version of CPRS.
User defaults can be set to display patients from a particular source (Primary Provider, Treating Specialty, Team/List, Ward Clinic, or Combination). The user can define the defaults (e.g. a specific clinic, ward, and provider) for each of these sources. Clinic locations can be specific for different days of the week. The patients displayed for a clinic can be restricted to only show patients with appointments during a specific date range. The order the patients are displayed can also be defined (e.g. alphabetical, room/bed, etc.). Personal patient lists can be defined. Criteria for a combination list of patients can be defined (e.g., patients for specific clinics and providers). These settings can be made using the Personal Preference options available from the CPRS menus (not the GUI menus). These parameters are further explained in the Appendices D and E of this manual that define the parameters in CPRS.
***

### Notifications

The order in which notifications are displayed on the patient selection screen of the GUI depends on the parameter ORB SORT METHOD. This parameter can be set at the SYSTEM, DIVISION, and USER level. The possible sort fields are:
-   P - Patient
-   M - Message
-   U - Urgency
-   I - Info
-   L - Location
-   D - Date/Time
-   F - Forwarded By/When
***

The sort order can be set using the Set Notification Display Sort Method (GUI) option on the Notification Management Menu [ORB NOT COORD MENU]. There should be no need to edit the parameter directly.
The urgency for any particular notification type can also be set from this menu, using the Set Urgency for Notifications (GUI) option. The urgency for a notification can be set at the USER, DIVISION, SERVICE, and SYSTEM levels. The combination of these two settings (urgency and sort order) allows a variety of methods for displaying the most important notifications for a given user.
## Graphing Configuration

The CPRS GUI 26 installation package includes new graphing functionality. Although graphing is enabled by default, to make the most of this functionality, you must configure graphing to use your site’s data sources and reflect its business rules. The following sections provide instructions for:
-   Disabling the graphing tool
-   Disabling the background graphing processing for caching
-   Identifying the data sources from which the graphing tool draws information
-   Setting up selected users with a privilege that enables them to create, edit, and save predefined graphs—called public views—that are available to all users
-   Creating graph reports (available on the **Reports** tab)
***

### Disabling CPRS Graphing

If you don’t want to provide graphing functionality for users at your site, you—or someone who has programmer access (required)—can disable it.
**Take the following steps to disable graphing:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select EP Edit Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWG GRAPH SETTING** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Enter selection prompt, type one of the following expressions: **Package, PKG, or 9.** Press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Replace prompt, type **@** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
**To subsequently enable the graphing tool:**
1.  Follow steps 1–4 above.
1.  At the Replace prompt, type the following value: **63;53.79;55;55NVA;52;70;120.5\|BCEFGHIK\|1\|4\|90\|\|100\|\|**. (This value represents CPRS GUI 26 default settings for the ORWG GRAPH SETTING parameter.)
### Disabling CPRS Graphing Background Processing

CPRS graphing will sometimes cache patient data so that it improves the performance of displaying graph results to the user. This extra processing can sometimes slow the overall system performance. The processing is done in the background and restricted using a resource device - ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE. This processing can be disabled or enabled at the System level.
**Take the following steps to disable graphing:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select EP Edit Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWG GRAPH SETTING** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Enter selection prompt, type one of the following expressions: **System, SYS, or 8.** Press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Replace prompt, make the 6th \| piece 0:
For example:
**63;53.79;55;55NVA;52;70;120.5\|BCEFGHIK\|1\|4\|90\|\|100\|\|.**
Replace 90\|\|100 with 90\|0\|100
It will now be
**63;53.79;55;55NVA;52;70;120.5\|BCEFGHIK\|1\|4\|90\|0\|100\|\|.**
***

**To subsequently enable background processing of the graphing tool:**
1.  Follow steps 1–4 above.
1.  At the Replace prompt, remove 0 as the 6th \| piece:
For example:
**63;53.79;55;55NVA;52;70;120.5\|BCEFGHIK\|1\|4\|90\|0\|100\|\|**.
Replace 90\|0\|100 with 90\|\|100
It will now be
**63;53.79;55;55NVA;52;70;120.5\|BCEFGHIK\|1\|4\|90\|\|100\|\|**.
***

### Disabling Data Sources

CPRS graphing uses the type value listed above for data mapping. If you want to disable one or more data sources—because your site doesn’t use them, they are politically sensitive, or they cause CPRS performance problems, for example—you use the type value to do so.
**Take the following steps to disable one or more data sources:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select EP Edit Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWG GRAPH EXCLUDE DATA TYPE** and  press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Enter selection prompt, type one of the following expressions: **System,** **SYS,** or **8.** Press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Value prompt, type the value types of each data source you want to exclude, separating each source with a semicolon. For example, type the following values to exclude laboratory tests and mental health assessments: **63; 601.2**. Press \<**Enter**\>.
**To enable all disabled data sources:**
1.  Follow steps 1–4 above.
1.  At the Value prompt, type **@** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.

### Editing Public Display Options and Views

CPRS graphing provides users with the ability to set and save display options and create and save predefined views. CPRS always displays graphs with user-level settings if these settings exist. If they don’t exist, CPRS displays graphs using public settings, which you or authorized users define at the system level. (Public views and settings are available to all of the users at your site, but only authorized users can create or alter these views and settings.)
CPRS stores all graph display settings using the ORWG GRAPH SETTING parameter. You can edit public settings by using the CPRS GUI. (See the “Configure Settings” section of *Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) User Manual: GUI Version* for step-by-step instructions. This manual is available online at <http://www.va.gov/vdl>.)
Before you can save public settings and views, you must first add yourself as a value in the public-editor (ORWG GRAPH PUBLIC EDITOR) parameter.
**Take the following steps to add yourself and/or other (trusted) users to the public-editor class:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select EP Edit Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWG GRAPH PUBLIC EDITOR** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Select Sequence Number prompt, type a sequence number and press the \<**Enter**\> key. (Type a question mark (**?**) at the prompt to determine the best sequence number. If no sequence numbers exist, type the number one (**1**) at the prompt.)
1.  At the User Class prompt, type your user class or the user class of the person to whom you are providing public-editor privileges. Press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  Repeat steps 4–7 as needed.
***

### Creating Graph Reports

If a significant number of users at your site frequently graph specific collections of items, you can incorporate these items in graph reports as a convenience to the users. That is, you can create graph reports and add them to the **Available Reports** list on the **Reports** tab. When users select graph reports, CPRS graphing opens to the selection of views that comprise the reports.
To create graph reports you must have:
-   Permission to edit file number 101.24 (OE/RR REPORT)
-   Permission to edit OR parameters
-   Permission to create, edit, or remove public settings and views (through the ORWG GRAPH PUBLIC EDITOR parameter)
***

Before you add graph reports to the **Available Reports** list, you must first:
-   Create the public views that you want to display as graph reports.
-   Create individual graph reports
-   Create a menu for graph reports
-   Add the menu to the **Available Reports** list
***

### Creating Public Views

Each graph report can incorporate one or two public views. If you plan to combine two views in a single graph report, set one of the views to display in the bottom of a split-pane view. You can find step-by-step instructions for creating public views in *Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) User Manual: GUI Version.* (Look for the “Creating Predefined Views” section of “Using CPRS Graphing.”) This manual is available online at <http://www.va.gov/vdl>.
### Creating Graph Reports

Your site’s graph reports must follow the conventions of file 101.24 (the OE/RR REPORT file).
**Take the following steps to create graph reports:**
1.  Log in to VA FileMan.
1.  At the Select option prompt, type the number **1** (for the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES selection) and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the INPUT TO WHAT FILE prompt, type either **101.24** or **OE/RR REPORT** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the EDIT WHAT FIELD prompt, type **ALL** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.

### Adding Your Graph Menu to the Available Reports List

The following instructions are for adding a graph menu to the **Available Reports** list, which you do by editing the ORWRP REPORT LIST parameter. This parameter is available for all levels (package level to user level). However, CPRS displays in its **Available Reports** list only the items in the lowest level that has entries.
For example, if this parameter has 20 reports listed at the package level and no reports at any other level, CPRS displays for all users the reports listed at the package level. If you then add one report at the system level, CPRS displays to all users on the system only this one report. Similarly, if you add one report at the user level, CPRS displays for this user only the one report.
In other words, if you want to add a report to the system level and still display all of the reports listed at the package level, you must add the package-level reports to the system level, and so on down to the user level.
**Take the following steps to view a listing of reports entered at all levels:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select LV List Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWRP REPORT LIST** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  Save this list for future reference.
***

**Take the following steps to add menus and reports to the** Available Reports **list:**
1.  Log into VistA.
1.  From the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select EP Edit Parameter Values.
1.  At the Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type **ORWRP REPORT LIST** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Enter selection prompt, type the name or number of the level to which you want to add the menu or report and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  At the Select Sequence prompt, type an unused sequence number and press the \<**Enter**\> key. Sequence numbers determine the order in which CPRS displays reports. To determine which sequence numbers are unused, type a question mark (**?**) at the prompt.
1.  At the Are you adding [number] as a new Sequence prompt, type **Yes** and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  Press the \<**Enter**\> key again to accept the sequence number.
1.  At the Report prompt, type the name of the report you want to add and press the \<**Enter**\> key.
1.  Repeat steps 5–8 until you have entered all menus and reports you want CPRS to display to users at the level you selected in step 4.

## Remote Data View Configuration

Remote Views allows you to review patient data that is collected at other facilities. Data can be retrieved from one, many, or all sites at which a patient has been seen. Those facilities must have Master Patient Index (MPI) installed. Remote Data Views use HL7 messaging and server-to-server connections with the RPC Broker. Health summaries can be used, but the retrieval site must have a health summary component of the same name. This means that nationally exported health summaries can be used. If sites wish to have specific types of health summaries available (e.g. VISN-specific patient reports), then those sites should coordinate the naming of those reports.
**Note:** The Adhoc health summary report and the imaging (local only) report (on the reports tab) will not return remote data. In addition, the Most Recent, Selected Tests by Date, Worksheet, and Graph lab report (on the labs tab) will not return remote data.
***

### Master Patient Index (MPI)

The Master Patient Index stores data about where and when patients are seen within the VA. The data as well as the location of the master record are transmitted to local facilities. This provides an index to where data has been stored. Data can be retrieved from these locations and viewed at any facility that has been configured for display.
### Configuring Remote Data Views

## Overview of Clinical Indicators Data Capture

CPRS controls the entry of Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC) information using two switches. When the switches are turned on, clinicians who hold the Provider key will enter diagnoses for orders. Two List Manager options on the OR BDC MENU control the switches:
-   OR BDC MASTER SWITCH—The master switch turns on CIDC functionality at the system level. However, individual clinicians will not be prompted for CIDC information until the OR BDC PROVIDER SWITCH is enabled for individual clinicians holding the Provider key.
-   OR BDC PROVIDER SWITCH—The provider switch must be assigned and enabled for each clinician that will use the CIDC features. The switch can be assigned and enabled for individual clinicians holding the Provider key one-at-a-time to allow for training or for all clinicians holding the Provider key at once. This switch can also be assigned and disabled for all those providers who do not have the switch assigned.
***

The following table shows how the two switches work together.
**System Switch Provider Switch Is CIDC displayed?**
On Off No
On On Yes
Off On No
Off Off No
### Enabling the Master Clinical Indicators Data Capture Switch

The master Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC) switch turns on the features at the system level, but users will see no changes until OR BDC PROVIDER SWITCH is enabled for the individual clinicians.
**Note:** Because this switch turns on or off these features for the system, great caution should be used before disabling this feature. If this switch is turned off, the diagnoses will not be collected. You must have Clinical Coordinator privileges to enable this switch.
***

**To enable the master CIDC switch, use the following steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, log in and type **OR BDC MENU** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Type **MS** and press **\<Enter\>**.
**Note:** When you choose this option, the application checks the status of the main CIDC switch and displays the status on the screen.
***

1.  Check to make sure the switch is OFF. To enable the Main switch, type **E** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Type **Q** and press **\<Enter\>** to leave this option.
***

The following capture shows an example of how to turn on the main CIDC Switch.

### Disabling the Main Clinical Indicators Data Capture Switch

The main Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC) switch can be turned off if there is ever a need.
**Note:** Because this switch turns on or off these features for the system, be careful about disabling this feature. If this switch is turned off, the order diagnoses will not be collected. You must have Clinical Coordinator privileges to disable this switch.
**To disable the main CIDC switch, use the following steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, log in and type **OR BDC MENU** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Type **MS** and press **\<Enter\>**.
**Note:** When you choose this option, the application checks the status of the main CIDC switch and displays the status on the screen.
1.  Check to make sure the switch is ON. To disable the Main switch, type **D** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Type **Q** and press **\<Enter\>** to leave this option.
### Assigning, Enabling, Disabling, and Reporting on the Clinical Indicators Data Capture Provider Switch

To give providers the ability to enter Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC), a coordinator or responsible person at each site must assign and enable this switch for individual providers. This switch (parameter) is somewhat different from other CPRS parameter because it is first assigned and then has a state of either enabled or disabled. CPRS provides the following methods to manage this switch:
-   **Manage Parameter by Provider** - This option allows the user to search for a specific clinician who has the Provider key and then assign and enable or assign and disable the switch (parameter) if it is not yet assigned. If the switch has already been assigned to the clinician, the user can either enable it if it is disabled or disable it if it is enabled.
-   **Assign Parameter and Enable for All Providers** - This option searches for all active clinicians who hold the Provider key that are not currently assigned the switch (parameter), assigns them the switch, and enables it.
-   **Assign Parameter and Disable for All Providers** - This option searches for all active clinicians who hold the Provider key that are not currently assigned the switch (parameter), assigns them the parameter, but disables the parameter. A coordinator or responsible person at the site would then have to enable these providers one-at-a-time.
**Note:** With the main CIDC switch disabled, the only change users will see if the CIDC patches are installed is that they will not have to address service connection for all eligible patients, not just those with more than 50% service connection.
***

Coordinators can also run three reports:
-   All active clinicians who hold the Provider key who have been assigned the switch and whether it is enabled or disabled
-   Active clinicians who hold the Provider key with the switch enabled
-   Active clinicians who hold the Provider key who have the switch but it is disabled
These reports show only active clinicians who hold the provider key and have been assigned the switch.
You must have Clinical Coordinator privileges to enable this switch and run the reports.
#### Managing the CIDC Provider Switch for Individual Providers

**To manage the provider switch for clinicians one at a time, use the following steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, log in and type **OR BDC MENU** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Type **PP** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  To assign and enable or assign and disable the switch for an individual provider, type **M** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  Enter the name of the individual that you want to complete CIDC information for the appropriate orders and press **\<Enter\>**. If more than one name appears, select the number for the appropriate person and press **\<Enter\>**.
The text will indicate if the provider you selected is enabled or disabled.
1.  If the switch for the provider is not enabled and you want to enable the CIDC switch for this provider, the prompt will ask if you want to enable the switch for that provider and Yes will be the default, press **\<Enter\>**. If the provider is enabled and you want to disable the switch, the prompt will ask if you want to disable the switch, and Yes will be the default, press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  To enable additional providers, repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have assigned it to all the clinicians who need it.
1.  When you have enabled or disabled the switch for the necessary providers, press **\<Enter\>** until you exit the option.

## SNOMED to Describe Problems in CPRS

The Office of National Coordinator of Health IT (ONC) has defined that the national terminology standard for Problem List is Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). CPRS implemented SNOMED CT so that clinicians can describe the problems the patient is experiencing using terms more familiar to them. CPRS also uses the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system version 10. SNOMED CT provides a standardized way to represent clinical statements, while the ICD system is more weighted toward billing codes.
### A New Mail Group for Term Review

When a clinician searches for the correct term for a patient’s problem, the look up and extended search may not find the term that the clinician wants. If the extended search fails, the clinician has the option to enter a free text term. The system creates a request that a new term be added to the clinical subset. Before this request is sent to the Standards and Terminology Services (STS) team, CPRS first sends it to the local OR CACS mail group, for them to review whether the site agrees that a new term should be requested. If the person reviewing the request agrees, the person can submit a new term request by going to the following web site and following the instructions there: http://REDACTED .
During the installation process for CPRS GUI v.29, one of the questions prompts the person installing the patch to designate the Mail Group Coordinator for the OR CACS mail group as shown below:

### NTRT Request Bulletin Sent to OR CACS Mail Group

After the creation of the mail group and installation of the necessary patches, when a user does a Problem List Extended Search that fails to find any candidate term, and the user chooses to enter a free text term, the system creates aN NTRT request, CPRS send the members of the OR CACS mail group a bulletin for a new term request that looks something like this:
Subj: NEW PROBLEM/DIAGNOSIS TERM REQUEST [\#106396] 10/03/11@14:13 33 lines
From: OR PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN In 'IN' basket. Page 1 \*New\*

Date/Time of request: 10/3/11@14:13
Name of requester: CPRSPROVIDER,FIFTY
Service: INFORMATION SYSTEMS CENTER
Location: ZZ ALBANY-PRRTP(500PA)
***

A New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) mail message has been sent to you
because a user from your facility has failed to find a suitable term
after initiating the search options within the Problem List application
and has chosen to request a new term to be added to the Problem List
subset.
***

Please review the requested term and verify it is understandable,
clinically useful, and does not already exist within the Problem List
subset. If the term is found appropriate, then submit a NTRT request at
the NTRT website, http:// REDACTED. Follow the link to
Access the NTRT Request Web Site.
***

The Problem List domain steward will review each request and respond to
you with the outcome of this request. If the term is approved by the
Problem List NTRT committee it will be added to the Problem List subset
and made available within future searches.
***

The progress of this request may be monitored by accessing the NTRT
website at the NTRT website.
***

If you have questions, need more information, or are having accessibility
problems with this website, please contact STS by Exchange E-Mail: [VHA
OI HDI STS NTRT].
***

Thank-you.
***

After conferring with local subject matter experts (SMEs) to determine if the site concurs with sending an NTRT request, the site designee will log in to the NTRT web site and file the NTRT Request.

## Cover Sheet Settings

### Background / Foreground Retrieval

The CPRS Cover Sheet may be populated by a foreground process. You must wait until this process is complete before moving to other activities. Populating the cover sheet with a background process allows the user to perform other chart activities while the cover sheet loads. There is some TaskMan overhead in using the background process, so the cover sheet will not load as fast. The allergies list box always loads in the foreground. The parameter, ORWOR COVER RETRIEVAL, controls which of the other list boxes on the cover sheet load in the background. No matter how many sections are selected to load in the background, only *one* background process is used to load the cover sheet. The following table lists the sections of the cover sheet along with the default value for background loading as exported by CPRS. You may override these settings by setting the parameter at the system level.
| **Section**                 | **Default Value** | **Description**    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Allergies/Adverse Reactions | No                | Load in foreground |
| Problem List                | No                | Load in foreground |
| Postings                    | No                | Load in foreground |
| Medications                 | No                | Load in foreground |
| Reminders                   | Yes               | Load in background |
| Lab Results                 | Yes               | Load in background |
| Vitals                      | No                | Load in background |
| Encounters                  | Yes               | Load in background |
To set any of these sections to load in the background, set the parameter ORWOR COVER RETRIEVAL for that section to “Yes.” To load a section in the foreground, set the parameter for that section to “No.” If you wish to change the exported setting for any section, it is best to set all sections. This will allow you to see exactly what is set.
*Example: Load all sections of the cover sheet in the foreground.*

When the cover sheet is loaded in the background, a resource device is used to limit the number of background processes that are committed to loading cover sheets. The resource device is ORW THREAD RESOURCE. It is exported with nine slots. If an error occurs while loading the cover sheet, it is possible that all the slots could become unavailable. When this happens, use the option “Monitor TaskMan”(XUTM ZTMON) on the TaskMan Management menu to show tasks waiting for the ORW THREAD RESOURCE DEVICE:
Checking Taskman. Current \$H=58337,48570 (Sep 00, 2000@13:00:00)

On node OER:CACHE there are 3 free Sub-Manager(s). Run
On node OER:NTA there are no free Sub-Manager(s). Run
Enter monitor action: UPDATE//
***

To clear the resource device, use Clear One Resource on the Device Management menu to clear each slot. Start with the highest numbered slot and work back to the lowest number to avoid inadvertently clearing a slot that is in actual use.
Select Device Management Option: CLEAR ONE Resource
Select RESOURCE NAME: ORW THREAD RESOURCE
Select SLOTS IN USE SLOT IN USE: 9
Select Device Management Option: CLEAR ONE Resource
Select RESOURCE NAME: ORW THREAD RESOURCE
Select SLOTS IN USE SLOT IN USE: 8
Select Device Management Option: CLEAR ONE Resource
Select RESOURCE NAME: ORW THREAD RESOURCE
Select SLOTS IN USE SLOT IN USE: 7
etc....
***

It is important to find the source of the error and fix it. Since the cover sheet calls into a wide variety of packages, the error could be in almost any namespace.
#### Customizing the Cover Sheet Layout

The CPRS Cover Sheet can now be customized using the ORWV1 COVERSHEET LIST parameter. With this change, sites can now decide which of the 10 items to display on the Cover Sheet:
-   ORCV ACTIVE PROBLEMS
-   ORCV ALLERGIES
-   ORCV POSTINGS
-   ORCV ACTIVE MEDICATIONS
-   ORCV CLINICAL REMINDERS
-   ORCV RECENT LAB RESULTS
-   ORCV VITALS
-   ORCV APPOINTMENTS
-   ORCV IMMUNIZATIONS
-   ORCV WOMEN'S HEALTH
***

How sites enter the sequence numbers will determine how the panels display. This parameter can be set at the System, Division, and User levels.
Sequence 1 begins in the upper left corner and panels are then placed in rows and columns according to sequence order. If there is only one or two items in a row, the panels expand to take up to the entire row.
***

**To customize the display of Cover Sheet panels, use these steps:**
1.  In Vista, go to the ORMGR CPRS Manager Menu.
1.  Type **IR** for CPRS Configuration (IRM) ... and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Type **XX** for General Parameter Tools ... and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Type **EP** for Edit Parameter Values and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME prompt, type ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the Level that you want to edit (available levels are System, Division, User).
1.  If you select Division or User, select the appropriate Division or User.
1.  If you are editing an already customized list and want to see what is already in a list, you may want to type a ? and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Select a Sequence prompt, select the sequence you want to add or edit (there are twelve possible, 1-12).
1.  If asked if you are adding a New Sequence, type Y and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Sequence *Number* prompt, press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Coversheet Report prompt, you can enter a Cover Sheet report or if you are unsure, type ? and press \<Enter\>, which will display a list of the possible reports. Then choose the report you want.
1.  Repeat steps 11 and 12 as needed to build the appropriate list.

### Content Criteria

The criteria for determining what gets loaded into each section of the cover sheet are listed below. Certain sections are affected by parameter settings. To set Cover Sheet parameters, use the “CPRS Configuration (Clin Coordinator)” menu option then “GUI Parameters” and then “GUI Cover Sheet Display Parameters” on the CPRS Configuration menu to set Cover Sheet parameters. These parameters may be set for the system, a division, a service, a location, or an individual user.
#### Problem List

Currently active problems are shown in the list.
#### Allergies

CPRS displays all allergies and reactions.
#### Postings

All currently active postings are shown.
#### Medications

If the patient is an outpatient, outpatient prescriptions are shown. If the patient is an inpatient, inpatient medications are shown. Only medications with the following statuses appear in the list:
-   Active
-   Drug Interactions
-   Hold
-   Incomplete
-   Non-verified
-   On Call
-   Pending
-   Provider Hold
-   Refill
-   Suspended
***

Medications that are not active (discontinued, expired, etc.) are not shown in the list. The medications on the list are displayed in inverse chronological order by the time of the order. In other words, they are listed from newest medication order to oldest medication order.
#### Reminders

The parameter, ORQQPX SEARCH ITEMS, controls which reminders are displayed on the Cover Sheet. After the reminders contained in ORQQPX SEARCH ITEMS are evaluated, those that are due are displayed. For sites with complex cover sheet reminder needs, a more comprehensive mechanism is available for defining cover sheet reminders (see the New Cover Sheet Reminder List section).
#### Lab Results

Lab orders that have been completed within the preceding number of days are listed. ORQQLR DATE RANGE INPT is used where the patient is an inpatient. The default value is two days. ORQQLR DATE RANGE OUTPT is used where the patient is an outpatient. The default value is 30 days. When changing the value of these parameters, caution should be used to not make the length of time too great. It can cause performance problems and memory allocation errors if a patient has a large number of lab orders and the time range is large.
#### Vitals

The most recent vital measurements are listed.
#### Visits/Admissions

Appointments and admissions that occur within a preset time frame are listed. The time frame is determined by the value of the parameters, ORQQVS SEARCH RANGE START and ORQQAP SEARCH RANGE STOP. ORQQVS SEARCH RANGE START identifies the beginning date for appointments and admissions. This date should be relative to the current date, entered as “T-n” where T is today and n is the number of days in the past. ORQQVS SEARCH RANGE STOP identifies the ending date for listing appointments and admissions. It should be entered as a relative number of days. CPRS is delivered with the beginning date set to “T-90” and the ending date set to “T”.
#### Immunizations
#### Women’s Health
## Problem Tab Settings

### Default Views

The user’s default view on the Problems tab is determined by two different settings.
Both the GUI and the List Manager versions of CPRS use the ORCH CONTEXT PROBLEMS parameter. Its value can be set at the SYSTEM and USER levels. The parameter takes the form of a semicolon-delimited string, with the different pieces meaning as follows:
a;b;c;d;e (example: T-180;T;A;1;1329)
a Begin date
b End date
c Status (A = active, I = inactive, B = both, R = removed)
d If “1”, show all comments as default
e Provider internal entry number
***

The user-level value for this parameter can be set using the **View \| Filter** menu and saving the selected settings as the default. There should be no need to edit the parameter directly at the user level.
Both the GUI and List Manager versions of CPRS use the PROBLEM LIST PRIMARY VIEW field (\#125) of the NEW PERSON (\#200) file. The contents of the field determine whether the outpatient (clinics) or inpatient (services) view of the problem list will be used, and can also be used to specify clinics or services to include in the list. The field will contain a “C” or “S,” followed by a list of internal entry numbers of clinics and services, separated by a forward slash ( / ) and ending with a trailing forward slash. Here is an example, excerpted from a VA FileMan INQUIRE into the NEW PERSON file for a user:
PROBLEM LIST PRIMARY VIEW: C/4/5/
-   “C” indicates outpatient (Clinics) view should be used. “S” indicates that the inpatient (Services) view should be used.
-   “4” and “5” are pointers to default clinics or services (depending on “C” or “S”) to include in the view. Others will be hidden. If none are specified, all will be shown.
***

For users of the GUI, it is best to use the **View \| Filter** menu to set this field. Save as Default will update it with the selected view and clinics or services to include. Because it is stored in the NEW PERSON file, it is applicable only to the individual user.
### Setting Up Problem Selection Lists

To create, maintain, customize, and assign problem selection lists for users, use the GMPL MGT MENU option, “Create Problem Selection Lists….” The following sub-options are available, and are documented in the manuals for the Problem List package:
1 Build Problem Selection List(s)
2 Copy Selection List from IB Encounter Form
\*\*\> Out of order: This option has been disabled due to the Problem List SNOMED CT implementation.
3 Assign/Remove Problem Selection List
4 Delete Problem Selection List
5 Check Problem Selection List Problem Codes
6 Import Problem Selection List
#### What Is a Selection List?

A Selection List is made up of CATEGORIES. Each CATEGORY contains specific PROBLEMS. Categories appear in the upper list box. When the user highlights a category in the upper list box, the problems in that category display in the lower list box.
There is now a National Problem Selection List that will display by default unless there is a Problem Selection List previously assigned. Use of National Problem Selection List is highly recommended because it will be maintained and distributed by a national group.
Sites can also create and use local lists, but the site will be responsible for maintaining all locals lists. Therefore, it is recommended that sites use the national list.
***

![P4163\#yIS1](media/9184fb432c44ad515f58b79d4171ecaf.png)
When a problem list is assigned, it will display on the left of the Problems tab. The VA-National Problem Selection List is shown above.
***

With the release of patch GMPL\*2.0\*49, some of the file locations where problem selection information is stored has changed. The new ORQQPL SELECTION LIST parameter will be where the selection lists for users or other entities will be assigned. This parameter holds a pointer to the Problem Selection List file \#125. Lists can be assigned at the User, Location, Division, or System levels.
As with all CPRS parameters, the higher the precedence or level will be used for the entity. For example, User is the highest or most specific precedence and System or Package is the lowest or most general. The package level is the most general and is only sent out by development normally. System would be more specific and so on, down to the user level.
#### Assigning Problem Selection Lists

With the changes with patches OR\*3.0\*429 and GMPL\*2.0\*49, please use the GMPL Assign/Remove list menu option to assign problem selection lists. See the *Problem List User Manual* and *Problem List Technical Manual* for additional information.
#### User Access and Privileges

If the user holds any of the ORES/ORELSE/PROVIDER keys, that user is viewed as a clinical user, and has full access privileges to all problem list options.
If a user holds the OREMAS key, that user is viewed as a clerical user. In that case, the Verify, Remove, Restore, and View Removed options will not be available. If the site parameter requiring verification is set to TRUE, then problems entered will be left in an UNVERIFIED state until a clinical user verifies them. Problems in the UNVERIFIED state are denoted by a dollar sign (\$) inserted at the beginning of the line.
These access levels are also enforced when problems are entered via the encounter form. Problems entered on the encounter form by clerical personnel will be left as UNVERIFIED.
CPRS List Manager and the Problem List package do not operate exactly the same as described above. The Problem List package evaluates the presence/absence of menu options in the user’s menu tree, and determines access accordingly. Since CPRS LM sometimes drops into PL package code, it uses a hybrid method of keys and menu options to determine access.
## Medications Tab Settings

### Medication List Content

All active medication orders are listed. In the case of outpatient orders, this includes medications that have been active within the last 120 days. So medications with a non-active status, such as DISCONTINUED, may be included in the list of outpatient medications. Each list of medications is sorted first by status. Active statuses are at the top of the list. Pending statuses are listed next, followed by any non-active statuses.
#### Active

Active statuses include:
-   Active
-   Refill
-   Hold
-   Suspended
-   Provider Hold
-   On Call
#### Pending

Pending statuses include:
-   Non-Verified
-   Drug Interactions
-   Incomplete
-   Pending
#### Non-active

Non-active statuses include:
-   Done
-   Expired
-   Discontinued
-   Deleted
-   Discontinued by Provider
-   Discontinued (Edit)
-   Reinstated

Within each group of statuses, the medications are sorted by expiration date, with those that expire last at the top of the list.
### How Long to Display Expired and Discontinued Meds

The CPRS parameter ORCH CONTEXT MEDS enables sites to set the length of time that expired and discontinued medications display on the Meds tab. This parameter does not affect the display of active medications, only how long expired and discontinued medications continue to display on the Meds tab.
CPRS enables the user to set a date range for which the expired and discontinued medications will display. For example, a user could decide to view the expired medications for the user from one year in the past (T-365). Or the user could set a period in the past such as June 16, 2006 to September 16, 2006. Normally, this date range should use relative dates such as T-180, T-365, or something similar.
The rules for how the date the user sets affects the display of Inpatient Medications, Non-VA Medications (Documentation), and Outpatient Medications are slightly different:
-   **Inpatient Meds**
-   Under Inpatient Medications, CPRS displays all expired and discontinued orders received from Inpatient Medications that have stop date and time that falls between the beginning and ending dates specified by the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS parameter.
-   If ORCH CONTEXT MEDS does not have a date, CPRS displays all active inpatient medications (including Pending) only. No expired or discontinued medications are displayed.
***

-   **Non-VA Meds (Documentation)**
-   CPRS displays all Non-VA Meds (Documentation) without a start date/time.
-   For active Non-VA medications (Documentation) to be displayed, the order start date if it has one must be between ORCH CONTEXT MEDS start and stop date.
-   The order start date does not need to be absolute, meaning it could only be a month and a year.
-   To display a Non-VA medication (Documentation) that has expired, the order stop date must be after the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS start date.
***

-   **Outpatient Meds**
-   CPRS displays all Active orders, including “active” Pending orders regardless of ORCH CONTEXT MED’s settings.
-   CPRS filters out deleted prescriptions and Pending orders that are DC (discontinued), DE (Discontinue edit), or RF (refill).
-   For outpatient medications, CPRS displays the orders from Outpatient Pharmacy that have a medication expiration date that is the same as the start date from ORCH CONTEXT MEDS or is closer to the present.
-   Outpatient Pharmacy ignores the end date of ORCH CONTEXT MEDS.
-   If CPRS does not pass a start date to Outpatient Pharmacy, then Outpatient Pharmacy uses a start date of T-120 or 120 days in the past.
***

### New Medication Orders

When a user clicks **Action \| New Medication**, the order dialog that is displayed is controlled by the parameter ORWDX NEW MED. The parameter allows separate values to be set for the inpatient and outpatient settings. If your site uses the standard PSJ OR PAT OE or PSO OERR orderable-item display lists, the default behavior of CPRS is to display the Inpatient Medication ordering dialog for inpatients and the Outpatient Medication dialog for outpatients. Using CPRS GUI versions 23 and later, authorized hospital locations can order inpatient medications for outpatients. (To make this option available, you must first install the following pharmacy and scheduling patches: PS\*1.0\*59, PSJ\*5.0\*111, and SD\*5.3\*285.)
For hospital locations that are authorized to place inpatient medication orders for outpatients, you can override the default behavior of the **Action \| New Medication** option through the ORWDX NEW MED parameter. Specifically, you can set this parameter to include menus that enable users to place these orders from the **Meds** tab. (See the [“Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients: Setting the ORWDX NEW MED Parameter” and “Ordering Menus and Quick Orders”](#inpatient-medication-orders-for-outpatients-setting-the-orwdx-new-med-parameter) sections of this manual for more information about displaying menus. For information about authorizing a hospital location to place inpatient orders for outpatients, see the “[Inpatient (Unit Dose) Medications for Outpatients](#clinic-orders-inpatient-orders-administered-in-clinic)” section of this manual.)
#### Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients: Setting the ORWDX NEW MED Parameter

Take the following steps to enable users at authorized hospital locations to order inpatient medications for outpatients from the **Meds** tab:
1.  Access General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS].
1.  Select Edit Parameter Values [XPAR EDIT PARAMETER’
1.  Select the New Med Dialog [ORWDX NEW MED] parameter. You can set this parameter at one of the following three levels:
-   User (USR) [choose from NEW PERSON]
-   System (SYS) [YOUR SYSTEM NAME]
-   Package (PKG) [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]
***

1.  Select the level at which you want to set the ORWDX NEW MED parameter.
1.  At the *Patient Status* prompt, enter o (for outpatient).
1.  At the *Order Dialog* prompt, enter your menu selection.
***

When (in CPRS) users subsequently select **Action \| New Medication** for outpatients, CPRS displays this menu. If the menu includes inpatient medications and users select an authorized Encounter Location for their orders, they can then order inpatient medications for outpatients.
***

#### Additional Options

##### Menu Options

You can also use the ORWDX NEW MED parameter to display other types of menus. For example, you can use this parameter to display a menu that directs users to the Orders tab for placing medication orders.
*Example: Display a menu that tells the user to use the orders tab for med ordering.*
The captioned output for a display-only menu looks similar to the following:
NAME: NO MED ORDERING DISPLAY TEXT: NO MED ORDERING
TYPE: menu COLUMN WIDTH: 80
SEQUENCE: 1.1
DISPLAY TEXT: Ordering not allowed from here - use the orders tab.
DISPLAY ONLY?: YES
TIMESTAMP: 58337,65573
***

Do the following, to attach this menu so that it displays when the user clicks **New Medication...**
Select General Parameter Tools Option: EP Edit Parameter Values
\--- Edit Parameter Values ---
Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: ORWDX NEW MED New Med Dialog
ORWDX NEW MED may be set for the following:
1 User USR [choose from NEW PERSON]
3 System SYS [REDACTED]
4 Package PKG [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]
***

Enter selection: 1 User NEW PERSON
Select NEW PERSON NAME: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN TC
***

\--------------- Setting ORWDX NEW MED for User: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN--------
Select Patient Status: Inpatient
Are you adding Inpatient as a new Patient Status? Yes// YES
Patient Status: Inpatient// Inpatient
Order Dialog: NO MED ORDERING
Select Patient Status: Outpatient
Are you adding Outpatient as a new Patient Status? Yes// YES
***

Patient Status: Outpatient// Outpatient
Order Dialog: NO MED ORDERING
Select Patient Status:
***

Note that the parameter needed to be set for both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Attaching a quick-order menu is done the same way. Of course, the quick order menu would contain medication quick orders and the medication ordering dialogs, rather than just display text.
##### Stop Date for Inpatient Medication Orders

With PSS\*1\*59 and PSJ\*5\*111 and later, you can specify a stop date that applies to all inpatient medication orders for outpatients. The PSJ CSD parameter allows you to define the information used to calculate the stop date for inpatient medication orders for outpatients.
**Note:**  Clinic Orders are affected by both CPRS auto-DC rules and Inpatient Medications rules for auto-discontinuing orders on admission and discharge. If sites do not want Clinic Orders to auto-discontinue on admission and discharge, sites will have to ensure that neither CPRS nor Inpatient Medications discontinues Clinic Orders.
## Orders Tab Settings

### Order View

The list of orders that are viewed may be configured in several ways. A user may list orders by Display Group. The sequence of Display Groups is controlled by the parameter, ORWOR CATEGORY SEQUENCE. This parameter may be set at the package, system, or user level.
*Example: Create a system level sequence for the order review screen and add a site defined Display Group for Restraints.*
From the XPAR MENU TOOLS option, use “LV” to list the exported values for the ORWOR CATEGORY SEQUENCE parameter.
Use “EP” to edit the ORWOR CATEGORY SEQUENCE parameter at the system or user level. The system and the user level do not “inherit” any values from the exported package level; it will be necessary to re-enter all the exported values for these levels.
If you wish to change the order of the exported display groups, you can change the sequence numbers.
Select Sequence: ?
***

***

The initial view that is shown on the orders tab is controlled by the parameter, ORCH CONTEXT ORDERS. This parameter may be set at the system level or for an individual user. The parameter is updated at the user level whenever a user selects **View \| Save as Default View...** While seldom done, you can change the default for the site by editing the parameter directly using the XPAR MENU TOOLS option. The default view is saved as a semi-colon delimited string.
*Example: Context string for All Current Orders, Reverse Sort, Group by Service*
ORCH CONTEXT ORDERS = “;;2;ALL;L;R;1”
1 - Beginning Date 5 - For List Manager Use
2 - Ending Date 6 - “R” if Reverse Sort
3 - Status Filter 7 - “1” if Group by Service
4 - Display Group
***

If you want to show orders with a completed status (complete, DC, etc.) in the Current Orders list for a number of hours after the time of completion, set the number of hours in the ORPF ACTIVE ORDERS CONTEXT HRS parameter. This may only be set at the system level. If you want the Current Orders list to only show pending, active, and hold orders, set the number of hours to 0.
If you wish to show the lab-assigned order number in the text of a lab order after it has been released to lab service, set the ORPF SHOW LAB \# parameter to “yes”. This may only be set at the system level.
#### Expiring Orders

Expiring orders are those orders with a stop time between the present and midnight of the following day and on which no user has taken an action less than 24 hours from the expiration date/time. If the “following day” is a holiday, all orders with a stop date between now and midnight of the day after the holiday expire. If a user takes an action on the order less than 24 hours before the expiration date/time, the alert will not be generated. There is no parameter to change this.
#### Active Orders

Active orders include orders that have a status of:
-   Hold
-   Flagged
-   Pending
-   Active
-   Scheduled
-   Partial Results
-   Unreleased
-   Renewed
***

Also, orders with the following statuses are included if they have been assigned that status within the number of hours identified by the parameter ORPF ACTIVE ORDERS CONTEXT HRS:
-   Discontinued
-   Complete
-   Expired
-   Cancelled
***

So recent activity in this case means that the orders expired, the patient was discharged, etc. within the number of hours identified by the parameter, ORPF ACTIVE ORDERS CONTEXT HRS. The parameter may only be set for the entire site; there are no other levels.
#### Recent Activity

Recent Activity (today’s orders) means the orders that have been released since midnight.
#### Recently Expired

This view looks only at order status not order action status. Looking at orders action status was causing duplicates with a DC/Edit and an Expired status. The number of hours that CPRS looks in the past for expired orders is defined in the parameter ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS. This parameter can be set only at the system level.
#### Unified Action Profile

This view displays a combined list of existing inpatient and outpatient medication orders from the local site on a single page. Using this view, a clinician can record decisions for all orders assigned to a patient to ensure that the correct medication orders are continued for the patient upon discharge.
The PHARMACY UAP Display Group includes the display members INPATIENT MEDICATIONS, OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS, and NON-VA MEDICATIONS (DOCUMENTATION). If expected orders do not display in the Unified Action Profile (UAP) view, additional display members can be added to the group. For example, Supply orders are omitted from the UAP view by design, but they can be displayed if the SUPPLY Display Group is added as a member of the PHARMACY UAP Display Group.
##### Modifying the PHARMACY UAP Display Group

To add additional display group members to the PHAMACY UAP Display Group, contact OIT for assistance; access to VistA programmer mode and FileMan are required to modify display group members. The PHARMACY UAP Display Group is stored in the DISPLAY GROUP file (\#100.98).
**To add display group members to the PHARMACY UAP Display Group:**
1.  Log in to VistA in programmer mode and navigate to FileMan.
1.  Select the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES option.
1.  At the “Input to what File: OPTION//” prompt, type DISPLAY GROUP.
1.  At the “EDIT WHICH FIELD: /ALL” prompt, type MEMBER.
1.  At the EDIT WHICH MEMBER SUB-FIELD: /ALL” prompt, press Enter.
1.  At the “Select DISPLAY GROUP NAME:” prompt, type PHARMACY UAP.
1.  At the “Select MEMBER: NON-VA MEDICATIONS (DOCUMENTATION) //” prompt, type the name of the Display Group to add to the PHARMACY UAP Display Group.
For example, type CLINIC MEDICATIONS to add the CLINIC MEDICATIONS member to the PHARMACY UAP Display Group.
1.  At the “Are you adding ‘CLINIC MEDICATIONS’ as a new MEMBER? No//” prompt, type Y (Yes).
1.  At the MEMBER SEQUENCE: 4//” prompt, press Enter to accept the default.
Note: The member sequence is not used by the UAP code modification.
1.  Repeat these steps to add each required display group to the PHARMACY UAP Display Group file.
#### Discharge Meds

This view displays a list of remaining active outpatient medication orders from the local site after order decisions are recorded in the Unified Action Profile. The orders to be released with the patient upon discharge are displayed.
***

### Ordering Access/Authorization

Access to ordering is controlled by a combination of several parameters. These parameters are modified from the XPAR MENU TOOLS option.
ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING can be used to prevent writing new orders and taking action on existing orders. It only affects ordering in the GUI; LM does not check this parameter. The main use for this parameter is for phasing in GUI order entry. It can be set at the system level initially (set ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING = “yes” at the system level). Then, as you wish to give individual users the ability to order via the GUI, the parameter may be set to “no” for each user.
ORWOR ENABLE VERIFY is used to allow nurses to verify orders in the GUI. List Manager does not check this parameter. It can be used in cases where you want to disallow GUI ordering, but still want the nurses to verify using the GUI and vice versa.
***

| Disable Ordering | Enable Verify | Behavior                                             |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes              | Yes           | Nurses can verify but users cannot order via GUI.    |
| Yes              | No            | Both nurse verify & ordering are disabled via GUI.   |
| No               | Yes           | Both nurse verify & ordering are allowed via GUI.    |
| No               | No            | Ordering is allowed in GUI, but nurse verify is not. |
OR OREMAS MED ORDERS determines what holders of the OREMAS key (clerks) are allowed to do with medication orders. The parameter may only be set at the system level. It may have the following values:
-   **0 NO**: A clerk is completely prohibited from handling medication orders.
-   **1 UNRELEASED ONLY**: A clerk may only enter unreleased orders for both Inpatient and Outpatient.
-   **2 YES**: Clerks may take action on all medication orders. A clerk may enter new medication orders or DC these medication orders. Inpatient orders may be released to the Pharmacy as 'Signed on Chart'. Outpatient orders will require the physician's signature.
***

ORWOR DISABLE HOLD ORDERS will remove the “Hold” and “Release from Hold” items from the Action menu. Some sites prefer to implement holds as generic orders rather than require users to identify the specify orders to hold. For example, the generic order “Hold all oral medications” might be created and used instead of the hold action.
#### Clinic Orders (Inpatient Orders Administered in Clinic)

The Clinic Orders project is designed to enable a CPRS user to order a unit-dose medication that is dispensed by inpatient pharmacy and administered to an outpatient in a clinic setting. Users can also order intravenous (IV) fluid infusion orders and Nursing text orders from an clinic location.
Clinic Orders also implements the display of those unit-dose orders, IV Fluid (Infusion) orders, and Nursing text orders two new display groups named Clinic Medications for Unit Dose orders and Clinic Infusions for infusion or intravenous orders. Clinic Orders allow VistA order checks to function for such medication orders. For the purposes of this document, Clinic Orders are defined as unit-dose medication orders, IV Fluid (Infusion) orders, and Nursing text orders written from an authorized clinics.
Sites must do specific set up steps before users will be able to write Clinic Orders. To see more about set up and what sites need to consider before implementing Clinic Orders features, please see the Release Notes for patch PSJ\*5\*121.
##### Designating Clinic Orders Locations

To create a Clinic Orders location, sites designate specific clinics as Clinic Orders authorized locations by setting the ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS? field (\#2802) to YES for the clinic, using either of these menu options:
-   Set up a Clinic
-   Inpatient Medications to Clinic
***

**Note:** To determine whether a location is an authorized Clinic Orders location, CPRS calls a Scheduling API to check if the patient has an appointment scheduled. As of the release of CPRS v.27, the Scheduling database is not yet ready. The API then returns a value of -3 to CPRS, which tells CPRS that the database could not be reached. CPRS then checks the location file and if the clinic is designated as a Clinic Orders clinic, the user can write Clinic Orders.
***

##### Configuring Users to Order Clinic Medications

To order Clinic Medication or Infusions, users must have the correct keys and secondary menu options.
-   **Keys:** Provider and ORES
-   **Secondary menu options:** OR BCMA ORDER COM and PSB GUI CONTEXT – USER
##### Ordering Clinic Orders from the Meds Tab

Clinic Medications and Clinic Infusions orders use new ordering dialogs if orders are being placed from the Meds tab. To use the Meds tab to place either a clinic medication or a clinic infusion orders, sites must do the following:
1.  In List Manager, select the Edit Parameter Values [**XPAR EDIT PARAMETER**] option.
1.  Enter the parameter **ORWDX NEW MED** parameter.
1.  Select the appropriate level: User, System, or Package.
**Note:** To set the package level, the user must be in programmer mode.
***

1.  At the Patient Status prompt, enter **Outpatient**.
1.  Add the order dialog **PSJ OR PAT OE** to the menu you have assigned to the Outpatient patient status.
1.  When done, you may exit List Manager.
***

##### Displaying Clinic Orders on the Meds Tab

On the Meds tab, all statuses (unreleased, pending, active, discontinued, expired, etc.) of Clinic Orders display at the top of the Inpatient Medications pane. Users can tell which orders are Clinic Medications or Clinic Infusions orders because Clinic Orders have a location in the location column. There is no set up required for this display to occur.
***

##### Displaying Clinic Orders on the Orders Tab

On the Orders tab, the order of display groups depends on the parameter ORWOR CATGEORY SEQUENCE. Sites need to decide where the Clinic Medications and Clinic Infusions display groups will appear. Sites may want to ensure that both Clinic Medications and Clinic Infusions display near Inpatient and Outpatient display groups. To do this, pick a sequence number close to the numbers for these display groups.
The ORWOR CATEGORY SEQUENCE parameter can be set at the Package, System, or User levels. Remember that to set the parameter at the Package level, the user must be in programmer mode. An example of setting this parameter is shown under [Order View](#261ztfg).
##### Displaying Flagged Order and Ward Comments on the Orders Tab

On the Orders tab, the display of flagged Order comments and Ward comments depends on the parameter OR FLAGGED & WARD COMMENTS. Sites can use this function to display these comments where Clinical staff can plainly see them. The setting is applied to both flagged Order comments and Ward comments, which are used to coordinate lab orders.
This display function can be turned On/Off. The default position is OFF (“0”). The setting is applied to both flagged Order and Ward comments. To enable the functionality, a CAC or OIT member must use the XPAR MENU TOOLS option to set the OR FLAGGED & WARD COMMENTS parameter to ON (“1”). This parameter is stored in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (\#8989.51).
##### Using Quick Orders with Clinic Orders

Sites must evaluate their quick orders based on the new processes to determine if they need to be edited for use with clinics.
For all of the following examples we will start on the Order Menu Management [ORCM MGMT] option in VistA.
###### Setting up Nursing Generic Text Orders

1.  Select **GO** Enter/Edit Generic Orders.
1.  At the select order dialog name, enter one of the following:
-   OR GXTEXT WORD PROCESSING ORDER
-   OR GXMISC GENERAL
-   OR GXTEXT TEXT ONLY ORDER
***

1.  Enter a generic order name at the Select Generic Order Name prompt.
1.  At the Type of Generic Order prompt select **Nursing.**
1.  Enter Display Text (optional).
1.  Continue through the rest of the prompts and answer appropriately for your site.
1.  The text instructions are entered at the Instructions: prompt.
**Note:** The Type of Display Group prompt is used to determine under which display group text orders will appear. If the user setting up Clinic Orders enters a group other than Nursing into this field, the text order will not follow the Clinic Orders rules. For Nursing quick orders, use the OR GXMISC GENERAL dialog.
***

###### To add text orders to an order set, use these steps:

1.  Select **ST** Enter/edit order sets.
1.  Enter the order set name.
1.  If entering a new order set, the user can copy the contents of another order set into the new order set.
1.  At the Select Component Sequence\#: prompt the user would select what sequence number they want the text order to appear in the order set.
1.  At the Item prompt the user would select name of the text order to add to the order set.
#### Permission to Write Supply Orders

The Supplies order dialog was created to separate ordering supplies from ordering medications. Supplies can be ordered by several kinds of users.
To order supplies, the following set ups can be used for these users:
-   For a provider or physician, the normal ordering keys and settings given to a physician (such as ORES, Provider, Authorized to Write Meds, etc.) will enable them to order supplies. They should NOT need to have the ORSUPPPLY key.
-   For nurses, an individual who holds the ORELSE and ORSUPPLY can order supplies without having the ability to order medications. A Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or similar person should assign the ORSUPPLY key to appropriate users with the Key Allocation option.
**Note:** If the user has the ORELSE and ORSUPPLY key, they user can order supplies and release the order to pharmacy. If the user has the ORELSE, ORSUPPLY, and PROVIDER key, the user will also show as the ordering provider.
-   For clerks, the user needs to have the OR OREMAS MED ORDER parameter set for the user and the ORSUPPLY key assigned to them. A CAC or similar person should assign these items to the clerk should the site want to give the ability to order supplies.
***

#### How Does CPRS Identify an Orderable Item as a Supply?

CPRS identifies an orderable item as a supply if it meets one of the following criteria:
-   drug class that begins with XA
-   drug class that begins with XX
-   a drug class of DX900 and the DEA special handling field set to Supply
***

### Writing Orders

The Write Orders list box serves as the point from which order writing is initiated. This list box can contain order menus, order sets, quick orders, or any order dialog. You may wish to begin by simply setting up the Write Orders list box so that it contains one item - a link to the same menu as that used by the OR ADD ORDERS MENU parameter. The CPRS GUI does not use OR ADD ORDERS MENU; it is used only by the List Manager interface. A different parameter is used because the “Write Orders” list box is not a multi-column orders menu. It was intended to provide an easy place to branch into a variety of order menus or general ordering dialogs. One way of looking at it is that it allows a user to have a series of context specific “Main Add Orders” menus.
There are two parameters that control the content of the “Write Orders” list box. Each parameter may be set at the system, division, service, location, or user levels. The older parameter is ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST. Each time this parameter is set for a given entity (user, location, etc.), every item in the list must be entered. To reduce the redundant entries, ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST was created. This parameter points to a menu in the Order Dialog file (101.41). You begin by creating the list of entries as a one-column menu in the Order Dialog file, and then set the parameter to reference that entry. Then, each time you need to set up a new user (or location, service, etc.) with that “Write Orders” list, you don’t have to re-enter every item.
A value for ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST will override a value for ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST if one is present. ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST will be the parameter that is manipulated set by future menu configuration tools. ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST remains for backwards compatibility.
*Example: Select a user and set up a “Write Orders” list that contains two quick order menus, an admission order set, plus the general laboratory ordering dialog.*
#### Configuring the Orders List Using the ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST Parameter

Use the General Parameter Tools option. Select EP, Edit Parameter Values.
Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST Write Orders (Inpatient)
ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST may be set for the following:
1 User USR [choose from NEW PERSON]
2 Location LOC [choose from HOSPITAL LOCATION]

Since the “Write Orders” list has been set up as a menu, you will only need to do the second step, setting the ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter, for any additional users.
The actual text used in the “Write Orders” list box is the text found in the LIST BOX TEXT field (\#55) of the Order Dialog file (\#101.41). If no text is present in that field, the value of the DISPLAY TEXT field (\#2) is used.
***

### Event-Delayed Orders

This section describes how to create, edit, and view a release event. Creating a release event allows CPRS users to write event-delayed orders that are not executed until the release event occurs. For example, you could create a release event called “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” that includes three different, but related treating specialties. A clinician could then write an order that would be delayed until the “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” release event occurred (i.e., the patient is transferred to one of the treating specialties). After the “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” event occurred, the order would be released.
#### Creating a Release Event

**Note:** Release events are stored in the OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS file (\#100.5).
**To create a release event, follow these steps**:
1.  Open the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu [OR PARAM COORDINATOR MENU].

#### Creating a Child Release Event

A child release event is a variation of a main or parent release event. A child release event shares the same trigger event as its parent; however, a child release event can be assigned to a different order menu than its parent release event.
For example, suppose your facility has a release event named “transfer to surgery ICU” that releases orders when a patient is transferred to the surgery ICU. This release event is appropriate for most of your needs; however, when a clinician writes delayed orders for a transfer to the orthopedic surgery ICU, you would like the clinician to be presented with a slightly different order menu. In this example, you could create a child release event called “transfer to orthopedic surgery ICU”. This child event would share the same trigger event as its parent; however, clinicians who selected the “transfer to orthopedic surgery ICU” child release event would be presented with a different order menu.
**To create a child release event, follow these steps:**

#### Explanation of Release Event Prompts (Fields in the OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS file \#100.5)

The list below explains the additional prompts (fields) that you may encounter when entering a new release event:
-   *Display Text* – the name of the release event as it appears to CPRS users.
-   *Type of Event* – the type of release event. The value of this field can be **A** (admission event), **T** (transfer event), **D** (discharge event), **O** (O.R. event), or **M** (manual release event).
-   *Division* – the division to which the release event will apply.
-   For admission events the division is the admitting location.
-   For discharge events the division is the location the patient is leaving.
-   For transfer events the division is the receiving location where the patient will be transferred.
-   For O.R. events the division is the location where the patient will have the procedure.
-   For manual release events the division is where the patient will be located.
***

-   *MAS Movement Type* – the MAS movement type that will trigger this release event.
-   For admission and discharge events it is recommended that this field be left blank unless you have a need for a very specific admission/discharge event. This way, any admission/discharge type will release delayed orders.
-   For O.R. events a MAS Movement type is not required.
***

-   *Select Included Locations* – the locations included in the release event.
-   *Select Included Treating Specialties* – the treating specialties included in the release event.
-   For O.R events a treating specialty is not required.
***

-   *Short Name* – a short name for the release event (used when space is limited on the Orders tab).
-   *Event Order Dialog* – the name of the dialog that appears when a user writes an event-delayed order assigned to the release event.
-   For admission events use OR(Z) GXMOVE EVENT or ADMIT PATIENT.
-   For discharge events use OR(Z) GXMOVE EVENT or DISCHARGE.
-   For transfer events use OR(Z) GXMOVE EVENT or TRANSFER.
![P4724\#yIS1](media/e04ecec34bfb6c5332b0caa8aedac3c1.png)The OR GXMOVE EVENT dialog.
***

-   *Order Set Menu* – the order set/menu that will appear when a user writes an event-delayed order assigned to the release event.
**Note**: Order sets listed in this field should be part of an order menu.
***

-   *Lapse in \# Days* – the number of days that an event-delayed order assigned to the release event will remain active. Once the number of days specified is exceeded, you can no longer release orders assigned to this release event.
-   *Ordering Parameters Location* – the location that the release event will use to retrieve its ordering parameters.
-   For admission, transfer, O.R., and manual release events, be sure to specify a representative location so that the appropriate parameter values for dialogs (such as dietetics and lab) are used.
-   For discharge events it is recommended that you specify a representative location so that the appropriate parameter values for dialogs are used. However, this is not required because the patient will be leaving the facility.
***

-   *Copy Active Orders* – indicates whether a user should be permitted to copy existing active orders to new event-delayed orders.
-   For admission and discharge events this field is usually set to no.
-   For transfer events this field is usually set to yes.
***

**Note**: You can configure the OREVNT EXCLUDE DGRP parameter to prevent orders belonging to specific display groups from being copied. For more information, refer to [Excluding Display Groups from the Copy Active Orders Dialog Box](#excluding-display-groups-from-the-copy-active-orders-dialog-box)

#### Defining a Default Release Event

The OREVNT DEFAULT parameter allows a CAC to control which event is presented as the default release event when a user writes a new event-delayed order (in both the CPRS GUI and List Manager).
**Note**: Before a default release event can be defined for a class, team, location, service, or division, you must define a list of commonly used release events for that level. (In other words, you must set the OREVNT DEFAULT LIST parameter.)

**Configuring the Discharge Release Event for Unified Action Profile**
The OR UNIFIED ACTION PROFILE OFF parameter enables the [Unified Action Profile](#unified-action-profile) functionality. When this parameter is turned ON, the Unified Action Profile menu options (Unified Action Profile (UAP) and Discharge Meds) display on the View menu of the CPRS Orders tab. When it is turned OFF, these options are not available to users.
In addition to turning this parameter ON, enabling UAP requires changing two settings for the Discharge Release Event using the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu. Both settings are accessible from the Event Delayed Orders option.
-   Activate the DISCHARGE event – Navigate to Event Delayed Orders and select Release Events; then activate the DISCHARGE Release Event by changing the Activate/Inactivate [AI] setting for the DISCHARGE event to ACTIVATE.
-   Disable Copy Active Orders for Discharge Release Events – Navigate to Event Delayed Orders and then configure the Discharge Release Event option by changing the Copy Active Orders setting to NO.
The medication reconciliation performed by UAP and the Discharge Meds view will not function as intended until the parameter is turned ON and these settings are configured.
#### Defining the Orders Menu for a Release Event

You can define which orders menu appears in the Write Orders pane (in the GUI) for a particular release event. You can do this by setting the ORWDX WRITE ORDERS EVENT LIST parameter.

#### Controlling who can Manually Release Orders

The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL and OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameters determine who can manually release an event-delayed order.
The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameter determines if the permission to manually release an event-delayed order is granted by:
-   the ORES and ORELSE keys (keys only).
-   the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (manual release parameter only).
\-or-
-   the ORES and ORELSE keys and the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (both keys and parameter).
The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter must also be set if the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameter is set to “manual release parameter only” or to “both keys and parameter.”

Use this setting if you want the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (discussed below) to control who can manually release an event-delayed order.
-   **B (Both Keys and Parameter)**
If you choose this option, CPRS will first check to see if the user has the ORES or ORELSE key. If they do, they will be allowed to manually release an event-delayed order. If the user does not have the ORES or ORELSE key, CPRS will then check the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter to see if they should be allowed to manually release the order.
**Note**: If you select P or B, you will also need to set the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter by following the instructions below in the [Setting the Manual Release Parameter (OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE)](#4hae2tp) section.

| 2                | TYPE OF EVENT                 | This is the event that should cause delayed orders to be released to the service(s) for action.  For OR events, the orders will be released when the TIME PAT IN OR field is entered in the Surgery package.   Orders delayed for Manual Release will not be automatically released by CPRS at all and can only be released via the "Release to Service" action by a user who is authorized to do so.  Authorization is controlled by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL, which lets sites choose whether release is controlled by keys or by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE or both.                                                            |
| 3                | DIVISION                      | This is the division that this event will apply to. For transfers across divisions, this field should be the new division that the patient is going to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4                | EVENT ORDER DIALOG            | This field contains the name of the dialog that will appear when you are writing a generic event-delayed order that requests this release event. If such an order is not necessary for this event, leave this field empty.  Unlike other delayed orders, the order created by this dialog will become active right away when signed and be visible on the Active Orders view as well as with the delayed orders on the Orders tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5                | ORDER SET/MENU                | This is a menu or order set containing items that are either necessary or commonly ordered when this event occurs.   The menu or order specified in this field will be invoked when first placing delayed orders for this event. If an EVENT ORDER DIALOG was defined for this event, this order set/menu will be presented to the user immediately following that dialog. This field may be any type of order dialog except prompt types.   **Note**: Order sets listed in this field should be part of an order menu.                                                                                                                                        |
| 6                | LAPSE IN \#DAYS               | Patient events are evaluated whenever delayed orders are acted upon or viewed. If the number of days specified in this field have passed since delayed orders were entered for this event and for this patient, then the status of all orders delayed for this event will be changed to "lapsed" and the patient event itself will be terminated. The orders can no longer be released to the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7                | MAS MOVEMENT TYPE             | This is an MAS Movement Type that can further define this event. This field is optional, but if it is defined then it must match the patient's movement data to satisfy the event and cause any delayed orders to be released.  For example, to have delayed orders released when a patient returns from pass, enter the movement type of AUTH ABSENCE 96 HOURS OR LESS, or leave this field empty to have the transfer event defined by other criteria such as treating specialty or ward location.                                                                                                                                                           |
|  8               | DISPLAY TEXT                  | This field is the name of the event as it will appear to the user in CPRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9                | ORDERING PARAMETERS LOCATION  | Many order dialogs use parameters that depend on location. The location specified in the Ordering Parameters Location field is used as the default location for retrieving those parameter values when delaying orders to this event.  The patient's actual location will be saved with the order at the time of its release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10               | INCLUDED TREATING SPECIALTIES | The treating specialties in this field are the treating specialties that can satisfy this event. If the patient's new specialty matches a specialty in this field, then orders delayed for this event may be released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 100.51,.01       | INCLUDED TREATING SPECIALTIES | This is a treating specialty that can satisfy this event. If the treating specialty is defined, then the patient's new specialty must match one in this list in order for any delayed orders to be released. A specialty may only be included in one active release event at a time.  If locations are also defined for this event then both the treating specialty and the location must match for orders to be released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11               | INCLUDED LOCATIONS            | These are ward locations that can satisfy this event. If the patient's new location matches a location in this list, then orders delayed for this event may be released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 100.511,.01      | INCLUDED LOCATIONS            | This is a ward location that can satisfy this event. If defined, then the patient's new location must match a location in this list for any delayed orders to be released.  A location may only be included in one active release event at a time. If this event also has treating specialties defined, then both the location and the treating specialty must match for orders to be released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Give Additional Dose Now Option on the Inpatient Medications Form

Clinicians working in CPRS can use the **Give additional dose now** option to order a new medication for an inpatient. The option is used when the first dose is to be administered immediately and ongoing doses are scheduled for administration on a regular schedule.
Depending on your version of CPRS, the order priority and dosing schedule may be set automatically or may require manual adjustments. The pop-up messages displayed will also vary.
When running CPRS v31a:
The dosing schedule and priority are set automatically for each order. However, both the NOW order and the ongoing order are given the priority selected when creating the order. For example, if the priority ROUTINE was selected, then both orders are assigned a priority of ROUTINE.
The administration schedule and priority for both orders are reflected in the Warning message displayed.
When running CPRS v32 or later:
The dosing schedule and priority are set automatically for each order.
VistA routine ORCSEND1 automatically creates two orders when the **Give additional dose now** checkbox is selected: one with the priority ASAP and one with the priority ROUTINE. The default value of ASAP can be changed by selecting a different value from the **Priority** field before submitting the order.
A popup warning message notifies users that selecting **Give additional dose now** creates two orders and automatically sets the priority. You need only sign once to send both orders to Inpatient Pharmacy.
For Complex orders, the functionality of the **Give additional dose** **now** option is the same as for Simple orders; however, a different popup message displays.
When running CPRS v32 or later, Delphi routine fODMeds.pas is used to enforce the required priority ASAP for the first Inpatient Medications order and ROUTINE for the second order when **Give additional dose now** is selected. This routine also modifies the warning message that displays to the user when this option is selected.
Sites that do not use the priority ASAP can select an alternative priority (for example, STAT) that will display in place of ASAP. A parameter (ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE) in VistA enables sites that do not have the priority ASAP in the Order Urgency file (\#101.42) to use this feature. If the priority ASAP is not present, or not available, an alternative can be selected from the Order Urgency file using the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] to edit the ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE parameter stored in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (\#8989.51). If an alternative priority is defined, then CPRS displays the alternative to ASAP when a new inpatient medication order is placed and **Give additional dose now** is selected.
### Automatically Discontinuing Orders (Auto-DC Rules)

A CAC can set up rules that will automatically discontinue an order when a specific event occurs. These rules are known as auto-DC rules. For example, a CAC can set up an auto-DC rule named “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” that automatically discontinues all lab, pharmacy, and diet orders when a patient is transferred to a medicine treating specialty. Although the auto-DC rule will discontinue lab, pharmacy, and diet orders, all other orders will remain active. A number of variables can be used in auto-DC rules, including specific divisions, orderable items, locations, and MAS movement types.
Prior to the release of OR\*3\*142 and OR\*3\*141, you could not specify which orders would be automatically discontinued when the specified event occurred. Instead, all of the orders would be discontinued.
**Note**: OR\*3.0\*142 changes the way auto-DC rules are created and processed. After OR\*3.0\*142 is installed, existing auto-DC parameters will be converted into entries in the OE/RR Auto-DC Rules file (\#100.6). The entries in the OE/RR Auto-DC Rules are for your division. Multidivisional sites will need to make copies of these rules for the other divisions in the system.

#### Explanation of Auto-DC Rules Prompts (fields in the OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES FILE \#100.6)

The list below explains the additional prompts (fields) that you may encounter when entering a new auto-DC rule:
-   *Display Text* – The name of the auto-DC rule as it will appear to CPRS users.
-   *Division* – The division that the auto-DC rule will apply to.
-   For admission rules, the division reflects the admitting location*.*
-   For discharge rules, the division reflects the location the patient is discharged from.
-   For O.R. rules, the division reflects the location where the patient is having the procedure.
-   For transfer and specialty transfer events, the division reflects the receiving location.
***

-   *DC Reason* – The reason that this auto-DC rule will discontinue an order.
-   *Excluded Display Groups* – The groups of orders (often subsets of the included packages) that are exceptions to this rule (should not cause the order to be discontinued).
-   *Excluded Treating Specialties* – The specific sending and receiving specialties that are exceptions to the rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued). This prompt (field) is specific to specialty transfer events.
-   *Except for Orderable Item* – An orderable item that is an exception to the rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued).
-   *Except from Observation –*The field indicates whether a patient leaving an observation treating specialty should be an exception to this rule. This field is only used in discharge rules.
**Note:** Medication orders in a “Pending” status cannot be exceptions to Auto-Discontinue rules for a Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. If this field is set to “YES” or set to “If Readmitting” and the user inputs “YES,” a pending medication order will still be Auto-Discontinued upon Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. Only medication orders in an “Active” status will be reinstated if the Except from Observation field is set to “YES” or if the user enters “YES” to the question, “Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?”
This field can be set in the following ways:
-   **Yes** – if you set the field to yes, a discharge from an observation treating specialty will always be an exception to this rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued).**[**0F**[^1]]**

[^1]: Except from Observation - Medication orders in a “Pending” status cannot be exceptions to Auto-Discontinue rules for a Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. If this field is set to “YES” or set to “If Readmitting” and the user inputs “YES,” a pending medication order will still be Auto-Discontinued upon Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. Only medication orders in an “Active” status will be reinstated if the Except from Observation field is set to “YES” or if the user enters “YES” to the question, “Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?
-   **No** – if you set this field to no, this rule will be applied regardless of whether the patient is discharged from an observation treating specialty.
-   **If Readmitting** – If you set this field to If Readmitting, the user will be prompted to enter whether the patient will be immediately readmitted. If the user answers yes, the order will not be automatically discontinued. If the user answers no, the rule will be applied.**[]**
-   *Inactivated –* After the date/time listed in this field, the rule will no longer be applied.
-   *Included Divisions* – For multidivisional sites, the specific sending divisions that are included in this rule.
-   *Included Locations –* The specific sending and receiving wards that the auto-DC rule will apply to. This prompt (field) is only used with transfer events (no specialty change).
-   *MAS Movement Type* – The MAS movement type that will trigger the auto-DC rule.
For a specialty transfer rule, the only movement type allowed is “Provider Specialty Change”. However, any transfer that includes a specialty change will trigger this rule, even if another movement type is entered.
***

-   *Type of Event* – The type of event that will trigger the auto-DC rule. The value of this field can be A (admission event), T (transfer event), D (discharge event), S (specialty transfer event), or O (O.R event).
-   *Type of Orders to DC* – Orders generated by the VistA package specified in this field will be discontinued.

#### Files Associated with Auto-DC Rules

##### OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES (\#100.6)

If this field is set to “YES” or set to “If Readmitting” and the user inputs “YES,” a pending medication order will still be Auto-Discontinued upon Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. Only medication orders in an “Active” status will be reinstated if the Except from Observation field is set to “YES” or if the user enters “YES” to the question, “Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?” This field can be set in the following ways: **Yes** – if you set the field to yes, a discharge from an observation treating specialty will always be an exception to this rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued).**[]** **No** – if you set this field to no, this rule will be applied regardless of whether the patient is discharged from an observation treating specialty. **If Readmitting** – If you set this field to If Readmitting, the user will be prompted to enter whether the patient will be immediately readmitted. If the user answers yes, the order will not be automatically discontinued. If the user answers no, the rule will be applied.**[]** |

#### Frequently Asked Questions about Event-Delayed Orders and Automatically Discontinuing Orders (Auto-DC Rules)
1.  **Can you disable the ability to write delayed orders?**
Yes. If a site has not defined any release events, then a user cannot write event-delayed orders.
1.  **Other packages (such as the Pharmacy package) have parameters that are related to events. Which parameters take precedence, front-door parameters (CPRS parameters) or back-door parameter (package parameters)?**
The package parameters are evaluated first and take precedence. If you want CPRS parameters to take precedence, turn off package parameters.
1.  **Can release events be created for non-MAS ward locations?**
Yes. Release events for non-MAS ward locations should be configured as manual release events.
1.  **Some sites have created service-display groups to sort generic text orders (for example, PCA and respiratory). Are the DC events related to the service or the display group?**
To identify orders, CPRS look at the package (OE/RR for all generic orders regardless of display group). If you define the OE/RR package as an included package for auto-dc, all generic orders will be discontinued regardless of the display group. However, if the *excluded display group* field is populated, the generic orders that are associated with the display group will not be auto-discontinued.
1.  **What happens if there is an excluded orderable item identified in the auto-DC file and the orderable item is changed in the host package?**
The excluded orderable items field should not be used to specify pharmacy items that may change frequently. If the orderable item is changed, the exception will not have any effect.
1.  **Should we remove our generic “transfer to” order dialog from the add orders menus?**
Yes, remove it from your add orders menus. However, you can use the “transfer to” order dialog as the order dialog for your transfer release events. You may also use the new OR GXMOVE EVENT dialog which prompts for the release event rather than the treating specialty.
1.  **Our Chief of Surgery does not feel that “Intensive Care Surgical” is a treating specialty. He wants, for example, “Vascular Surgery” with location of ICU. What do you suggest?**
There are two answers to this question. You can change your facility treating specialties to be more specific for intensive care. Or, you can create an “Admit to Vascular Surgery Intensive Care” release event and tie it to the appropriate treating specialties.
1.  **Can you delay outpatient meds for same-day surgery?**
Yes. You should use manual release in this case.
1.  **Treating specialty choices are controlled by MAS. What parameters should I look at or change to add a treating specialty?**
Facility treating specialties are usually edited by HIMS staff. Please consult with your site staff.
1.  **The patient goes from a ward to OR to PACU to ward. The patient is still on** **ward location when orders are written (e.g. patient is not transferred in the computer). How do we write orders to start in PACU?**
Create a release event called OR to PACU (of type “Surgery”). Set up a print location for each OR room and define the printer in PACU. When the OR nurse enters time out of OR, the post-op orders will release and print to PACU.
If you have other orders that need to release when the patient goes to ward, use the manual release function.
1.  **Do surgery events auto-DC in real-time? What happens if the system is down, the surgery information is entered later, and the patient has already returned to the ward?**
Yes, surgery events auto-DC in real-time. When the system is back online, coordinate recovery efforts between surgery staff members who are backloading data and clinicians who are processing orders. If necessary, inactivate the rule while time out of OR is backloaded and then reactivate.
1.  **Can you set lapse days differently for each ward or specialty?**
Yes.
1.  **Is there a field or other identifier on the orders tab indicating that an active order was originally entered as a delayed order?**
No, however, this information is included in the detailed order display.
1.  **Can you make an auto-DC rule that does not auto-dc specific generic text orders (e.g. DNR orders) that remains active throughout the patient’s hospitalizations?**
Yes, define it as an excluded orderable item in the appropriate auto-DC rule. You could also create a special display group for this type of order and then add that display group to the "excluded display group" field so that orders belonging to this display group would not be auto-discontinued.
1.  **Can MAS discontinue orders when a patient goes to surgery without a treating specialty or ward location change?**
Yes. You can define an auto-DC rule for a surgery type that will discontinue orders based on the time-out of OR.
1.  **What is the status of a delayed order that has lapsed?**
The status will be “Lapsed”.

### Lapsing Orders

CPRS has a function to lapse delayed orders and unsigned orders after a period of time that sites can set. CPRS lapses orders within one hour after the period of time the site sets have passed as long as the ORMTIME function is working. For example, if the site set unsigned Inpatient Medication orders to lapse after 3 days, CPRS lapses the order between 72 and 73 hours from the date/time that the user accepted the order.
CPRS has two parameters and a field in the delayed order event creation software that control how orders lapse:
-   **OR LAPSE ORDERS parameter** – For unsigned orders, this parameter controls after how many days the order in a specified display group should lapse. Each display group can have a different number of days. There is no default setting for this parameter. Sites must set this value if they want the orders from different display groups to lapse at the same time. This parameter works in conjunction with the OR LAPSE ORDERS DFLT parameter explained below. To have order lapse for after a specified number of days, site will have to set this parameter. To set this parameter, use IR CPRS Configuration (IRM), then XX General Parameter Tools, and EP Edit Parameter Values.
-   **OR LAPSE ORDERS DFLT parameter** – For unsigned orders, this parameter sets a default number of days after which orders will lapse if the number of days is not already defined for their display group in the OR LAPSE ORDERS parameter. This parameter does not have a value on installation and must be set by sites if they want orders to lapse automatically. Sites can therefore set this default and then any values for specific display groups or sites can simply set each display group in the OR LAPSE ORDERS parameter. To set this parameter, use IR CPRS Configuration (IRM), then XX General Parameter Tools, and EP Edit Parameter Values.
-   **LAPSE AFTER \# DAYS** **field** – For delayed orders, the user creating or editing events can define the number of days after which the orders for a release event can be released. After the number of days is exceeded, the orders cannot be released. For more information, please see the [**Explanation of Release Event Prompts (Fields in the OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS file \#100.5)**](#1au1eum) of this manual.
***

CPRS also has a report that identifies lapsed orders. The report is located under the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu:

### Personal Quick Orders

Some exported ordering dialogs allow the user to create their own quick orders. These quick orders are shown at the top of the leftmost list box in the order dialog. The list of quick orders for each user is stored in the following parameters:
ORWDQ ANI Imaging Dialog, Angio/Neuro Orders
ORWDQ CARD Imaging Dialog, Cardiology (Nuc Med) Orders
ORWDQ CSLT Consult Dialog
ORWDQ CT Imaging Dialog, CT Scan Orders
ORWDQ DO Dietetics Dialog, Diet Orders
ORWDQ IV RX IV Fluid Dialog
ORWDQ LAB Dialog
ORWDQ MAM Imaging Dialog, Mammography Orders
ORWDQ MRI Imaging Dialog, MRI Orders
ORWDQ NM Imaging Dialog, Nuclear Med Orders
ORWDQ O RX Outpatient Medication Dialog
ORWDQ PROC Procedures Dialog
ORWDQ RAD Imaging Dialog, Radiology Orders
ORWDQ TF Dietetics Dialog, Tubefeeding Orders
ORWDQ UD RX Inpatient Medication Dialog
ORWDQ US Imaging Dialog, Ultrasound Orders
ORWDQ VAS Imaging Dialog, Vascular Lab Orders
ORWDQ XRAY Imaging Dialog
***

When a user creates a personal quick order, the contents of the quick order itself are stored in the Order Dialog file (\#101.41). These Quick Orders are all stored in the ORWDQ namespace. The internal name of the Quick Orders entry will look something like, ORWDQ 0D7682BC. The second part of the name is a hexadecimal representation of the quick order checksum. This hex number is used to avoid the creation of identical (and redundant) quick order entries.
### Ordering Menus and Quick Orders

Ordering menus may be activated from the “Write Orders” list box. The menu display window works like a browser window. The user moves through menus by selecting items in the display. It is possible to navigate forward and backwards through menus that have been selected by clicking the forward and backward arrows at the top of the screen. The user can exit the menu tree at any level by clicking “Done”. This behavior differs slightly from the List Manager interface. The Path Switch field (\#53) of the Order Dialog file (\#101.41) is currently ignored by the GUI menu navigator.
When a quick order is selected from the menu, the subsequent behavior depends on what is in the VERIFY ORDER (\#8) and the AUTO-ACCEPT QUICK ORDER (\#58) fields of the Order Dialog file (\#101.41).
| Verify | Auto-Accept | Behavior                                               |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| No     | No          | Full ordering dialog shows                             |
| Yes    | No          | Accept/Edit/Cancel dialog shows before order is placed |
| No     | Yes         | Order is placed without further user interaction       |
| Yes    | Yes         | Accept/Edit/Cancel dialog shows before order is placed |

If any required fields have not been set up in the quick order, the full order dialog is shown.
When the quick order is evaluated, the following steps are done for each prompt in the dialog on which the quick order is based:
1.  The value for the individual prompt is loaded, if available.
If the prompt does not have a value, the DEFAULT field (\#17) of the Order Dialog file is executed.
1.  The ASK ON EDIT ONLY (\#8), ASK ON ACTION (\#9) and REQUIRED (\#6) fields of the Order Dialog file are evaluated to see if this prompt requires user interaction.
1.  The ASK ON CONDITION field (\#13) of the Order Dialog file is executed, again to see if the prompt requires user interaction.
At the end of this evaluation, the order dialog responses are passed to the client. If user interaction is necessary, the ordering dialog is displayed with the evaluated responses as default values. If no further interaction is necessary and VERIFY ORDER is yes, the accept/edit/cancel dialog appears. If the order does not require verification and AUTO-ACCEPT is yes, the order is saved without any further interaction.
### Tracking Antimicrobial Quick Orders

Antimicrobial drug quick orders can be tracked to enhance auditing capabilities by adding a “tracking hook” to the orders. This functionality is enabled by two TIU Objects (hooks) added to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (\#8925.1): the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT\| hook tracks clinically preferred antimicrobial drug orders; the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)\| hook tracks orders that prescribe an alternative to a clinically preferred antimicrobial drug.
**Note**: Sites that do not wish to track antimicrobial prescribing practices using quick orders, or do not use the VISN 23 Antimicrobial Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), do not need to perform the setup steps for using the antimicrobial hooks and reporting features described in this document.
To enable antimicrobial quick order auditing, a CAC or Office of Information and Technology (OIT) member must set up an antimicrobial drug quick order that includes the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT\| hook or the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)\| hook in the Comments field. The CAC or OIT member must also add the antimicrobial quick orders to a menu in CPRS where they can be selected by clinicians when placing an antimicrobial drug order.
**Note:** When setting up Antimicrobial Quick Orders, respond YES at the "Verify Order" prompt and NO at the "Auto-Accept" prompt. If a YES response is made at the "Auto-Accept" prompt, then two pharmacy confirmation numbers will appear in the new antimicrobial quick order tracking file and subsequent Quick Order Audit reports. This does *not* result in the creation of multiple drug orders.
When a clinician places an antimicrobial drug quick order in CPRS by selecting a quick order containing the hook, a pharmacy confirmation number is displayed with other order information such as the medication, dose, schedule, and special instructions. This pharmacy confirmation number can be used to look up additional details about the order in VistA.
When the medication order is accepted by the clinician, an order number is assigned and serves as verification that the order was completed. The OR Quick Order Nightly Background Task [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG] option is a background job that adds the order number to the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file (\#100.95) if an order is accepted. This job runs every 24 hours by default.
This functionality is turned ON by adding one of the two hooks to antimicrobial quick orders defined for the site. The functionality is turned OFF by removing the hook from the Comments section of any quick orders previously configured with the hook. To completely turn off this functionality, the scheduled background job [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG] must also be turned off.
The following steps outline the process required to create antimicrobial quick orders that use one of the two antimicrobial tracking hooks and to add CPRS menu option that provide access to the preconfigured antimicrobial quick orders.
**Note**: Sites that utilize a CDSS to select quick orders associated with antimicrobial drugs can continue using the CDSS without interruption. Quick Orders preconfigured with a \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT\|, \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (CI)\|, or \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE)\| hook will be automatically converted to the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT\| hook. Quick Orders preconfigured with the \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (ALT)\|, \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (CI-ALT)\|, or \|ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE-ALT)\| hook will be automatically converted to the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)\| hook.
**STEP 1: Create a CPRS menu option for Antimicrobial Quick Orders**
In this example, the new menu is named “ANTIMICROBIAL QUICK ORDERS” and displays when the ANTIMICROBIALS option is selected from the Add New Orders menu.
To create a CPRS menu for antimicrobial quick orders, log in to VistA and then respond to the prompts as follows:
At the “OPTION NAME:” prompt enter ‘ORCL MENU’ (Clinical Coordinator's Menu).

At the “Clinical Coordinator's Menu Option:” prompt, enter ‘PE’ (CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)).

At the “Order Menu Management Option:” prompt, enter ‘MN’ (Enter/edit order menus).

At the “ORDER MENU:” prompt, enter ‘ANTIMICROBIALS’.

At the “Are you adding 'ANTIMICROBIALS' as a new ORDER DIALOG? No//” prompt, enter ‘Y’ (Yes).

At the “Do you wish to copy an existing menu? YES//” prompt, enter ‘N’ (NO).

Enter the following to define the menu:

DISPLAY TEXT: ANTIMICROBIAL QUICK ORDERS

DESCRIPTION: \<ENTER\>

COLUMN WIDTH: 30

MNEMONIC WIDTH: 2

PATH SWITCH: \<ENTER\>

ENTRY ACTION: \<ENTER\>

**STEP 2: Create quick orders associated with antimicrobial drugs**
Create quick orders for commonly prescribed antimicrobial drugs. It is recommended that quick orders be created for both Primary and Alternative drug choices.
**Note**: Although not required, it is recommended that the naming schema for antimicrobial quick orders use a prefix to help clinicians easily distinguish between inpatient and outpatient orders. For example:
-   (PSOZID) for outpatient medication orders
-   (PSJZID) for inpatient Unit Dose orders
Configure the new antimicrobial quick orders for Primary (clinically preferred) and Alternative (alternative to a clinically preferred) drugs by placing one of the two antimicrobial tracking hooks in the Comments section of the quick order:
-   **Primary drugs**: Enter \|**OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT**\| in the Comments section of the quick order for a clinically preferred antimicrobial medication
-   **Alternative drugs:** Enter **\|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT\|** in the Comments section of the quick order for an alternative antimicrobial drug.
**Note**: Although not required, it is recommended that the naming schema for antimicrobial quick orders help clinicians easily distinguish between Primary and Alternative drugs (e.g., include “ALT” in the name of a quick order for an Alternative medication).
**Example 1: Outpatient order for a Primary drug**
Create a quick order for ACYCLOVIR tablets and enter the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT\| hook in the Comments section to enable auditing capabilities. In this example, ACYCLOVIR is a clinically preferred drug.
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medication: ACYCLOVIR
Instructions: 1 pill by mouth
Priority: ROUTINE
Comments: \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT\|
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider naming the quick order using a schema that identifies it as an outpatient order. Use a prefix (e.g., “PSOZID”) in the name to indicate an outpatient order (“PSOZID ACYCLOVIR”).
**Example 2: Inpatient order for an Alternative drug**
Create a quick order for VALACYCLOVIR and enter the \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)\| hook in the Comments section to enable auditing capabilities. In this example, VALACYCLOVIR is an alternative to a clinically preferred drug.
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medication: VALACYCLOVIR
Instructions: 2GM/1VIAL IV PIGGYBACK Q4H
Priority: ROUTINE
Comments: \|OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)\|
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider naming the quick order using a schema that identifies it as an inpatient order. Use a prefix (e.g., “PSJZID”) in the name to indicate an inpatient order (“PSJZID ACYCLOVIR”).
Because this is an Alternative drug choice, consider including that information ( e.g., “ALT”) in the quick order name (“PSJIZID-ALT VALACYCLOVIR”). These conventions make this quick order easily identifiable as an inpatient order for the Alternative antimicrobial VALACYCLOVIR.
**STEP 3: Add antimicrobial quick orders to the ANTIMICROBIAL QUICK ORDERS menu**
In this example, the ANTIMICROBIAL QUICK ORDERS menu displays when the ANTIMICROBIALS option is selected from the Add New Orders menu. This process will populate the ANTIMICROBIAL QUICK ORDERS menu to provide clinicians with a list of antimicrobial quick orders configured with the tracking hook.
At the “OPTION NAME:” prompt, enter ‘ORCL MENU’ (Clinical Coordinator's Menu).

At the “Clinical Coordinator's Menu Option:” prompt, enter ‘PE’ (CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)).

At the “Order Menu Management Option:” prompt, enter ‘MN’ (Enter/edit order menus).

At the “ORDER MENU:” prompt, enter ‘ANTIMICROBIALS’.

At the “Select Action: Next Screen//" prompt, enter ‘Add’ and specify the quick order name and display details. For example:

ITEMS: \<ENTER QUICK ORDER NAME\>

ROW: \<ENTER\>

COLUMN: \<ENTER\>

Using the Menu Editor, add each previously configured antimicrobial quick order as a Menu Item on the new Antimicrobial Quick Orders menu.

### Antimicrobial Quick Order Auditing Options

Six VistA quick order auditing options enable auditing and tracking of quick orders for antimicrobial medications.
-   The OR Quick Order Nightly Background Task [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG] adds the order number to the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file (\#100.95) after an order is accepted. This job runs every 24 hours by default and must be turned OFF to completely disable auditing functionality.
-   The OR Quick Order Audit Menu [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MENU] option provides access to four additional quick order auditing options:
-   The OR Quick Order Audit Inquiry [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT INQUIRY] option retrieves order details from VistA for individual antimicrobial quick orders. The pharmacy confirmation number assigned to a quick order in CPRS can be used to look up order details in VistA. Enter the pharmacy confirmation number at the “Inquiry” prompt of the OR Quick Order Audit Inquiry option to display order information. If the drug order has been accepted by the clinician, the Order number displays with other order information. If the drug has not been accepted, no order number is assigned.
-   The OR Quick Order Audit Print option provides information about antimicrobial quick order usage. Date range fields are provided to limit the report output to a specific time period. The information in this report reflects provider medication decision trends because a pharmacy confirmation number is recorded any time an antimicrobial quick order containing one of the Quick Order Audit hooks is created, even if the order is not accepted. If the order is accepted, an order number is also included. This report uses a Print template and a Sort template, each named [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT REPORT], to display information from the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file.
-   The OR Quick Order Audit Monthly [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MONTHLY] option prints a monthly report of antimicrobial medication orders for a specified group of Medical Center divisions configured in the QUICK ORDER DIVISION GROUPS file (\#100.953). This report separates antimicrobial orders into those placed using a quick order and those placed using a method other than a quick order.
This report is intended to be exported in a delimited format to an HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE) at the standard device prompt “DEVICE:” for import into Excel. Before the standard prompt is presented, the new prompt "Do you want a delimited report to a printer or home device ? NO//" is presented to facilitate those sites that do not have access to an HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE). For more information on generating this report, see [*Using the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly Report*](#using-the-or-quick-order-audit-monthly-report) on page [.](#using-the-or-quick-order-audit-monthly-report)
Before using this report, it must be configured using the OR Quick Order Division Groups Edit option.
-   The OR Quick Order Division Groups Edit option enables editing of the QUICK ORDER DIVISION GROUPS file. This file allows large facilities to filter the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly report into groups of Medical Center divisions to be included in separate reports. The selected divisions are stored in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISIONS field (\#100.9531). This field only supports selecting from existing entries found in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (\#40.8). Proper configuration requires each site to create one or more group names and then add all subordinate divisions to include in the group. When a group is added, the user is prompted for the divisions to include; a different subset of divisions may be selected for each group. Sites desiring only one report must include all of the Medical Center divisions associated with their facility in a single group.
**Note**: The Quick Order Audit Inquiry [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT INQUIRY] report may not accurately record antimicrobial quick orders in the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file (\#100.95) when processing multiple delayed orders at one time. Due to an issue with legacy delayed order processing of quick orders, the system does not transmit all the required variables for antimicrobial quick order tracking. This may result in inaccuracies when using the inquiry report.
However, the Quick Order Audit Monthly [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MONTHLY] report provides accurate information for all orders, and can be used in its place. This report retrieves information from the Order file (\#100), and provides real-time data on all antimicrobial orders. The report separates Quick Orders and Non-Quick Orders and can be used to identify antimicrobial quick orders for verification and auditing purposes. Those individuals assigned the Quick Order Audit Menu [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MENU] have access to the monthly report.
### Using the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly Report

Use the OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MONTHLY option to create reports of Quick Order and Non-Quick Order antimicrobial ordering for a division.
The OR Quick Order Audit Monthly Report:

-   Includes orders that were placed using a quick order and orders that were placed using another ordering method.
-   Displays a comparison between unsigned antimicrobial orders and signed antimicrobial orders. A signed order has an order number because it was accepted.
-   Can be manually run as required to analyze antimicrobial order use.
**Note**: The report sorts through all orders written during a specified timeframe of 31 days or less. Results for antimicrobials accepted using a quick order are displayed first, followed by results for antimicrobials that were placed without a quick order. This distinction helps with auditing of antimicrobial prescribing practices.
-   Can be printed or exported as delimited output.
To use the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly Report, each site must first create one or more group names in the QUICK ORDER DIVISION GROUPS file (\#100.953).
Use the OR Quick Order Division Groups Edit option to configure group(s) by selecting them from the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (\#40.8). A “?” can be entered at the prompt to retrieve a list of available divisions. All subordinate Medical Center divisions to display on one report must be added to a Division Group. Sites desiring only one report must add all Medical Center divisions to one group.
**Note**: This report can be run by a pharmacy user with permission to run the option for any period of up to 31 days for which data is present in the system. The report includes details on all antimicrobial drug orders placed during the reporting period specified by the user.
**To run an OR Quick Order Audit Monthly Report:**
1.  Select the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly option (3) from the OR Quick Order Audit Menu.
2.  At the “Enter Starting Date:” prompt. enter ‘T-31’ or any number of days less than 31 days.
3.  At the “Enter Ending Date:” prompt, enter ‘T’ or any date after the starting date covering a period of not more than 31 days.
4.  At the “Select MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION GROUP:” prompt, enter the name of a local division group (e.g., “CHEY”) to include in the Audit Report.
5.  At the “Do you want a delimited report to a printer or home device? NO//” prompt, accept the default NO response to export the report in a delimited format to an HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE), or enter YES if your site does not have access to a host file device.

    If you accept the default response NO, then the prompt “DEVICE: HOME//” displays. You can choose to send a delimited report to the HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE) or to have a non-delimited report sent to the screen or other printer.

    ![](media/57b45205a4695df328ad25c01ff987eb.jpg)

    Delimited Report Sent to a Printer or Home Device – NO Response

    If you enter YES at this prompt, then the prompt “DELIMITED REPORT DEVICE: HOME//” displays, enabling you to send delimited output to any available device. From this prompt, you can send a delimited report to the screen or to a printer, but you will have to use other methods (for example, turning on logging) to capture the delimited report so that it can be imported into Excel the same way that a host file device would deliver the report.

    ![](media/6c39054fd5dc3ba5ecbd2b39bb315dd4.jpg)

    Delimited Report Sent to a Printer or Home Device – YES Response

6.  At the “Do you want to print orders with MISSING LOCATIONS? NO//” prompt, accept the default NO response to leave out orders that do not include a location, or enter YES to include those orders.

    The report will print a list of antimicrobial prescriptions ordered by both quick order and non-quick order methods; it includes orders written during the specified time frame for all Medical Center divisions included in the selected Division Group.

    The following example depicts a report of antimicrobial orders for the Division Group “CHEYENNE” that were entered without using a quick order (“Non-Quick Orders”). The Order number is populated, indicating that the order was accepted.

    Orders placed using a quick order display in a separate section of the report.

### Ordering Dialogs

For entries in the Order Dialog file where TYPE=Dialog, an additional field, WINDOW FORM ID (\#55), is often present. This field tells the client which window should be displayed for that particular ordering dialog. The values this field can take are listed below:
-   1555 Clinic Infusions
-   117 Outpatient Meal/Dietetics
-   1105 Allergy/Adverse Reaction
-   110 Consult
-   112 Procedure
-   171 VITAL SIGNS
-   120 Laboratory
-   151 General Purpose Generic Order
-   999 Word Processing Order
-   100 Generic Activity
-   115 Diet
-   150 Patient Care
-   170 VITAL SIGNS
-   135 Medications
-   145 Non VA Medications
-   1444 Clinic Medications
-   130 Inpatient Medications
-   180 Infusion
-   140 Outpatient Medications
-   140 Supplies
-   160 Imaging
-   125 Blood Products
-   175 Return to Clinic
It is generally not necessary to edit the WINDOW FORM ID field. If no value is found, a value of 152 is assumed and a generic ordering dialog is constructed on the fly based on the prompts defined for the dialog. Most dialogs defined by sites will either be based on OR GXMISC GENERAL, where WINDOW FORM ID = 151, or will be generic dialogs constructed on the fly and have no WINDOW FORM ID.
#### Some Troubleshooting

If a generic ordering dialog allows selection of an Orderable Item (i.e., contains OR GTX ORDERABLE ITEM as a prompt), the INDEX value must be set for the appropriate subset of entries of the Orderable Item file. For example, in OR GXMISC GENERAL, the values for the first prompt are:
SEQUENCE: 1 ITEM: OR GTX ORDERABLE ITEM
DISPLAY TEXT: Patient Care: REQUIRED: YES
INDEX: S.NURS HELP MESSAGE: Enter a patient care item.
ORDER TEXT SEQUENCE: 1
SCREEN: I ‘\$G(\^(.1))!(\$G(\^(.1))\>\$\$NOW\^XLFDT)
XECUTABLE HELP: N IDX,SCR S IDX=\$G(ORDIALOG(PROMPT,”D”)),SCR=\$G(ORDIALOG(PROMP
T,”S”)) D XHELP\^ORDD43(IDX,SCR)
EXIT ACTION: N OI S OI=+\$G(ORDIALOG(PROMPT,INST)) D:OI ORDMSG\^ORCD(OI)
***

The S.NURS value for the INDEX field indicates that the selections should be limited to entries in the Orderable Item file that belong to the NURS set. If this is not set up properly, the “B” cross reference is used for sorting and you may see odd behavior with respect to items that are not all upper case.
Order dialog in the GUI use the ID field to reference different prompts within the dialog. There have been occasional circumstances where the text of diet additional orders appears to be blank. This is almost always caused by a missing ID value in the OR GTX FREE TEXT 1 entry of the Order Dialog file. This entry should look like this:
***

NAME: OR GTX FREE TEXT 1 DISPLAY TEXT: Instructions:
TYPE: prompt PACKAGE: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
DATA TYPE: free text DOMAIN: 1:240
**ID: COMMENT**
DESCRIPTION: This term gets a line of free text for generic orders.
TIMESTAMP: 58261,43117
***

### Allergy/Adverse Reaction Tracking Dialog

CPRS uses the GMRAOR ALLERGY order dialog—which is stored in the ORDER DIALOG file—to communicate directly with the Allergy/Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) package. The ART package does not allow users to enter free-text causative agents. When users attempt to enter allergies or adverse reactions for causative agents that are not in the local or national ALLERGIES file, CPRS displays a dialog box giving users the opportunity to request the addition of these agents. When users choose to initiate such requests, CPRS sends the requests to the GMRA REQUEST NEW REACTANT mail group, which patch GMRA\*4.0\*17 provides.
Each site must populate this mail group with people who are authorized to decide which causative agents should be included its local ALLERGY file. If sites have not populated this mail group, users who attempt to request additions to the local ALLERGY file receive the following message:
![Unable to Send Bulletin: "Mail group GMRA REQUEST NEW REACTANT has no members - contact IRM.](media/d1b3b187398faf52b24a0e2eb0e32267.png)
The message box CPRS displays if users request the addition of a reactant and their sites have not populated the GMRA REQUEST NEW REACTANT mail group.

Based on a parameter setting in the ART package, users may also be able to indicate via CPRS whether they have marked allergies and adverse reactions on patients’ identification (ID) bands (for inpatients). Specifically, if sites set the MARK ID BAND parameter to **1** (**YES)**, CPRS activates the **ID Band Marked** checkbox (for inpatients) in the **Enter Allergy or Adverse Reaction** dialog box. On the other hand, if sites set the parameter to **0** (**NO)**, CPRS deactivates the checkbox. Three related parameters determine if and how sites notify members of the GMRA MARK CHART mail group (or a specified order-entry team) when users do not indicate that they have marked allergies and adverse reactions on patients’ ID bands. For more information about these parameters, see the [*Adverse Reaction Tracking Technical Manual*](http://www.va.gov/vdl/VistA_Lib/Clinical/CPRS-Advrs_Reaction_Trk_(ART)/allr4_tm.pdf)*.*
***

### Outpatient Medication Order Dialog

The default value for the “Pick Up” prompt in the outpatient medication dialog may be controlled with a parameter. ORWDPS ROUTING DEFAULT may be set to the following values:
-   W Pick up at window.
-   M Send by mail
-   C Administered in clinic
-   N No default. The user is required to choose window, mail, or clinic.
***

This is the value used for the general medication dialog and for quick orders if the “Pick Up:” prompt (OR GTX ROUTING) has not been set. Once a value has been selected, that value becomes the default for subsequent orders in the session.
### Entering Custom Reasons for Non-VA Meds

For each Non-VA medication entered into CPRS, the user can select a reason why the patient is taking the medication. Four statements or reasons exported at the package level of the GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons parameter are as follows:
-   Non-VA medication not recommended by VA provider.
-   Non-VA medication recommended by VA provider.
-   Patient wants to buy from Non-VA pharmacy.
-   Medication prescribed by Non-VA provider.
***

At the System or Division level for this parameter, sites can enter their own reasons or statements, including the above if they choose to, at the system or division level of this parameter. The parameter asks for a sequence number to let the user determine what order it should display the reasons, and the user can then enter a reason up to 60 characters in length. Sites can enter any number of reasons they choose, but should use good judgment and not create too many reasons that would make it difficult for users to enter the appropriate reasons.
**To change the reasons in the GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons parameter, use the following steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, use the menu option **NV GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons** under the **GUI Parameters** option of the **CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)** menu and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Enter 1 for Division or 2 for system and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  If you chose 1, type the name of the institution and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  At the Select Sequence prompt, type a sequence number and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  When asked if you are adding a new sequence with the number you entered, type **Y** and press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  When the Sequence prompt displays with the number by it, press **\<Enter\>**.
1.  At the Statement/Reason prompt, type the text that you want CPRS to display as one of the statements/reasons the patient is taking a non-VA medication. (The limit for the reason/statement is 60 characters.)
1.  Repeat steps 4-7 as needed to create the list of statements/reasons.
1.  When finished entering reasons, type an up caret (**\^**) and press **\<Enter\>** to exit the menu.
### Entering a Message for Inpatient Clozapine Orders

Clozapine is usually prescribed in an outpatient setting, but it can be ordered for inpatients. However, the special appropriateness order checks that occur when finishing in the backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy setting do not occur in the finishing process in backdoor Inpatient Pharmacy. In addition, backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy sends the clozapine information to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) database. Some sites have directed the ordering provider to place a corresponding outpatient order when placing an inpatient clozapine order. The sites that have this policy can use the new OR CLOZ INPT MSG parameter to help reinforce this policy to the ordering providers.
**To edit this text, use these steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, go to the menu option CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)….
1.  Type **GP** and press \<**Enter**\> for GUI Parameters.
1.  Type **CLOZ** and press \<**Enter**\> for GUI Edit Inpatient Clozapine Message.
1.  Type the name of the warning and press \<**Enter**\>.
1.  In the text entry area that displays, enter the needed text.
1.  When finished, press \<**Num Lock\> + e**, which will save the text and exit to the GUI Parameters menu option.
### Entering a Message for Controlled Substance Orders With No Patient Address

Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) regulations require a patient address for controlled substance prescriptions. If an attempt is made to place a controlled substance order for a patient without a valid ZIP code, a message is displayed informing the ordering provider that a valid patient address is required, and the order is not placed. Sites can use the OR ZIP CODE MESSAGE parameter to provide information to the ordering provider to assist with getting the patient’s address updated.
**To edit this text, use these steps:**
1.  In the List Manager interface, go to the menu option **CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)**.
1.  Type **GP** for GUI Parameters and press \<**Enter**\>.
1.  Type **ZIPM** for Enter/Edit Missing ZIP Code Message Parameter and press **\<Enter\>.**
1.  Type **1** for Division to customize the message for the Division, type **2** to customize the message for the system and press **\<Enter\>.**
1.  If Division was selected in the previous step, select the Division name and press **\<Enter\>.** If System was selected in the previous step, proceed to the next step.
1.  At the “Value:” prompt, enter the needed text.
1.  When finished, press **\<Enter\>,** which will save the text and exit to the GUI Parameters menu option.
### Return to Clinic

To help improve scheduling capabilities in the VA, CPRS has added a Return to Clinic dialog that enables providers to place an order for one or more return appointments for a patient. The information is then transmitted to the Scheduling package where a scheduler can set one or more return appointments.
**Note:** The Return to Clinic dialog will only be accessible if the new Scheduling enhancements are in place, which will be released in patch SD\*5.3\*671. CACs can create Quick Orders and add the Return to Clinic Order Dialog to any menu before the SD patch is installed. If a user tries to access the Return to Clinic Order Dialog before the SD patch is installed, they will see an error message in CPRS stating the Order Dialog cannot be use until the SD patch is installed.
If your site does not use the package level settings for the Write Orders list, you will need to add the Return to Clinic items to the ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST set up for your site at the appropriate level (such as System, Division, etc).It may need to be added to your Write Orders menu.
There are two parameters that set up items in the Return to Clinic dialog:
-   OR SD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION that enables sites to put some information in a the More information field of the dialog.
-   OR SD PREREQ DIALOG where sites can add items to display in the Prerequisites drop down in the dialog. These are text only items to remind the scheduler to remind the patient of anything the provider wants them to do before the next visit, such as labs, radiology, etc.
### VBECS Installation and Setup

CPRS provides an electronic interface between VA providers and the updated Blood Bank Lab application, VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS). For the CPRS VBECS order dialog to work effectively; quick orders meeting local operations need to be provided with administrative instructions by local Clinical Applications Coordinators (CACs).

A simultaneous Lab order is processed when a VBECS order is placed. Lab orders need to be accessioned in the Lab application to be available for processing in the VBECS application. This does NOT place a Nursing Administration order. An order set of quick orders may be locally configured to link the Nursing Administration order to the VBECS order dialog.

#### Order Dialog

The VBECS Order Dialog (VBEC BLOOD BANK) must be placed by the CAC appropriately in the site’s Order menus. This dialog creates an order for blood components to be made available by the VBECS system, as well as any supporting diagnostic tests. It includes 6 components and 5 diagnostic tests. This new VBECS Blood Bank order dialog is an important aspect of the system. This is the only way to order blood products—you cannot use the file 60 method to create blood bank quick orders.
**☞ Note:** When OR\*3.0\*212 is installed it removes the ability to order blood bank tests through the lab application. The only way to order blood bank tests now is through the VBECS Order dialog in CPRS.
The VBECS Order Dialog is a unique structure. During use, it has direct communication with the VBECS Package via HL7 and VistA Link. The dialog has 3 parts:
1.  Patient information tab displays Blood Bank information about the patient.
1.  The Orders tab gives access to the ordering dialogs.
1.  The Lab Results tab displays lab results defined within the VBECS application based on the components being ordered.
![Blood Component and Diagnostic Test Order Form with 3 text boxes with arrows pointing to selected components and tests, and a section for ordering blood ](media/e73f85cee1f3b95f38e2298819c2362c.png)
***

The VBECS order dialog can be used to create:
-   Order Sets
-   Quick orders
-   Personal Quick Orders
***

But its main purpose is to order blood products, a topic which is covered in the CPRS GUI User Manual
#### Quick Orders

The recommended method for creating quick orders for VBECS is to use the Enter/edit quick orders action of the Order Menu Management. Here follows an example to this process:

#### Auto-DC Blood orders

Your facility should consider how you want the BLOOD PRODUCTS dialogue orders to auto/dc and refer to Appendix G of this manual for further instructions.
#### Parameters

VBECS comes with the following parameters:
OR VBECS COMPONENT ORDER List of Blood Components
OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE Text for Network Error
OR VBECS LEGACY REPORT Show Legacy (VISTA) Blood Bank Report
OR VBECS MODIFIERS List of Component Modifiers
OR VBECS ON VBECS Functionality Site Enabled
OR VBECS REASON FOR REQUEST List of Reasons for Request
OR VBECS SUPPRESS NURS ADMIN Suppress Nursing Admin Prompt
ORWDXVB VBECS TNS SCREEN Max time between TYPE & SCREEN and order
***

These are available for local setup for the sites particular requirements or local needs.
The OR VBECS COMPONENT ORDER parameter determines the sequence in which the components appear in the selection list.
The OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE contains text for the error message displayed when CPRS cannot contact the VBECS server to fill in dialog information. The VBECS order process can still proceed because the finished order is transmitted via HL7. You can replace the supplied text of this message with information about your own local procedures, possibly including the Blood Bank phone number.
The OR VBECS LEGACY REPORT parameter determines whether the Legacy (VistA) Blood Bank Report is displayed after the VBECS blood bank report is displayed. Currently this must be Yes for you to see this information.
The OR VBECS MODIFIERS parameter allows local configuration of the blood component modifiers. Specifically, it allows you to enter the sequence in which the modifiers should appear in the selection list.
The OR VBECS ON parameter toggles VBECS ON and OFF. Yes means ON, which is the default.
The OR VBECS REASON FOR REQUEST can be used to add site specific reasons for requests making them available for the clinician to select when placing an order.
The OR VBECS SUPPRESS NURS ADMIN parameter disables the prompt/pop-up that tells the user they must enter a Nursing Administration Order manually after entering a VBECS Blood order. Disabling this feature is usually done when a Nursing Administration order has been created and added to a VBECS order set or quick orders.
The ORWDXVB VBECS TNS CHECK parameter sets the number of days to check for a Type & Screen Order. The default is 3 days, but a site may override this by modifying this parameter.
### Signing Orders / Exiting the Chart

When a user exits the chart a window may display that contains orders that require a signature. The orders displayed in this window are controlled by the parameter OR UNSIGNED ORDERS ON EXIT. This parameter may be set to the following:
-   0 Only unsigned orders from the current session appear.
-   1 Unsigned orders by the current user for the currently selected patient appear.
-   2 All unsigned orders for the currently selected patient appear.
The orders are checked initially in the list box. They may be individually unchecked to prevent a signature code from being applied to them.
For holders of the ORELSE key, the parameter OR SIGNATURE DEFAULT ACTION controls which radio button is checked by default on the Review / Sign Changes screen. The following values are possible:
-   OC Signed On Chart may be checked (based on OR SIGNED ON CHART).
-   RS Release without Signature will be checked.
***

The parameter, OR SIGNED ON CHART, applies to OREMAS key holders and ORELSE key holders who have “Signed On Chart” as their default action. If OR SIGNED ON CHART is yes, then “Signed on Chart” is checked by default. Otherwise the default is “Hold for Signature”.
#### Digitally Signing Orders

To allow provider to digitally sign orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) requirements that uses card readers, smart cards known as Personal Identification Verification (PIV) cards with personal identification number (PIN), and digital certificates to authenticate users and digitally sign outpatient orders for controlled substances. This project would make it possible to eliminate the use of handwritten or “wet” signatures being sent to pharmacy and pave the way for completely electronic medication ordering.
There are several things that need to happen for the authentication to work correctly. When the user enters an order for a controlled substance, CPRS requests that the user insert the user’s PIV or smart card into the card reader and then enter the PIN. When the PIN has been entered, CPRS uses standard Windows security features to validate the certificates of the provider.
The PIV or smart card contains information about the provider including the following:
-   Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
-   PIN
-   Digital certificate
***

##### Digital Signatures Fields and Parameters

To make digital signatures possible in CPRS, developers added two new parameters and expanded one field and added four fields to CPRS files. The following fields were modified or added:
-   The Signature Status field (4) of the ORDER ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100) was modified to include a “Digitally Signed” order status.
-   The External Text field (.01) of the ORDER ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100) was added to store the external text of an order. The external text of an order gets passed to Kernel’s signing COM object and is used to create the digital hash.
-   The Digital Signature field (23) of the ORDER ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100) stores the digital hash (encrypted external order text).
-   The Drug Schedule field (24) of the ORDER ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100) stores the Controlled Substances Federal Schedule of the drug, which is used to see whether a digital signature is required.
-   The Digital Signature Required field (25) of the ORDER ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100) stores the indicator of whether the order requires a digital signature.
***

| **Field Name**                        | **Field Description**                   | **New Field** | **Data Type**   | **Identifier** | **Uneditable** |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| SIGNATURE STATUS 100.008,4            | Signature status of the order           | No            | Set             | No             | No             |
| EXTERNAL TEXT 100.008, .01            | Order text stored in external format    | Yes           | Word Processing | No             | Yes            |
| DIGITAL SIGNATURE 100.008,23          | Digital Signature of the order          | Yes           | Free Text       | No             | Yes            |
| DRUG SCHEDULE 100.008,24              | CS Federal Schedule of the drug         | Yes           | Free Text       | No             | No             |
| DIGITAL SIGNATURE REQUIRED 100.008,25 | Set if a digital signature is required. | Yes           | Set             | No             | No             |

**Important Items**

-   **New Field Added to the Institution File** - Kernel patch XU\*8\*267 added a new field to the Institution file (\#4), called FACILITY DEA NUMBER, which must have a value before this patch is installed. Integrated sites, Multi-divisional sites and sites that have sub-stations that users are able to sign in to (clinics, nursing homes, etc.) must also have the Facility DEA Number entered for those sub-station entries in the Institution file (\#4).
-   **Required Information** - If you install this patch without entering the all the required Facility DEA Numbers, your physicians will not be able to order controlled substances. You should be able to get the Facility DEA\# from the Pharmacy or Pharmacy Chief. With the Facility DEA\# and your institution name, use VA FileMan to enter the data, as follows:
***

Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
***

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: INSTITUTION//
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// FACILITY DEA NUMBER
THEN EDIT FIELD:
***

Select INSTITUTION NAME: \<Enter your institution name\>
FACILITY DEA NUMBER: \<Enter your Facility DEA\# here\>
***

##### Enabling Digital Signature Entries

To enable digital signature, also referred to as DEA ePrescribing, the Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) must make sure two files entries are enabled. The two file entries are
-   **ePCS SITE ENABLE/DISABLE:** This enables the digital signature feature for the site in general, but individual users must still be enabled. To use this option, the user must hold the OREPCSSITE key.
-   **ePCS USER ENABLE/DISABLE:** This enables the digital signature feature for the individual user selected. To use this option, the user must hold the OREPCSUSER key.
***

Upon initial installation of patch OR\*3.0\*218, the post-install routine will automatically enable the entire site through the EPCS SITE ENABLE/DISABLE entry, and it will enable electronic prescribing of controlled substances entry for all users that have either a DEA number or a VA number that allows them to write orders for controlled substances. Someone at each site, such as the credentialing office or pharmacy (your site will need to decide who will do this), will need to ensure that the users are assigned the correct pharmacy schedule for which they should be allowed to write controlled substance medication orders (specified schedules or all schedules II-v). Instructions are given below.
***

###### Enabling or Disabling Users for DEA ePrescribing

**After the initial installation, sites will need to enable individuals using the following steps:**
**Note:** To enable the ePCS USER ENABLE/DISABLE parameter, the user must hold the OREPCSUSER key and must not hold the XUEPCSEDIT key. The keys are exclusive—if the user holds one, the user may not hold the other. If the user does not hold the OREPCSUSER key or holds the XUEPCSEDIT key, the system will not display the ePCS User Enable/Disable option.
***

1.  Log in to the appropriate VistA account.
1.  Select the ePCS User Enable/Disable option. (OR EPCS USERS PARAMETER or to navigate to it, use these options: ORMGR\> PE CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) ...\> GP GUI Parameters\> DEA GUI ePCS Management Menu\> ePCS User Enable/Disable).
1.  At the USER NAME prompt, type the name of the provider and press \<Enter\>.
The system will then display the user’s current status of enabled or disabled and ask if you want to change it.
1.  Check that the provider is currently NOT enabled.
1.  When prompted if you want to enable the provider, type YES and press \<Enter\>.
1.  To enable or disable other users, repeat steps 3-5.
***

To disable a user, use the same steps as above. After you enter the user’s name, the system should show them as “enabled”, and ask if you want to disable them.
Below is an example showing how ePCS is enabled for a user.

###### Enabling or Disabling the Site for DEA ePrescribing

When the DEA Set Up patches are installed, the site will be enabled for electronic prescription of outpatient controlled substance orders (ePCS). In case of an emergency, sites could turn off the ability to electronically prescribe these substances.
**Warning:** Do not disable this unless there is an emergency or you have been instructed to do so. When ePCS is disabled, providers are required to order all controlled substance using paper prescriptions.
***

**Note:** To use the ePCS SITE ENABLE/DISABLE option, the user must hold the OREPCSSITE key and must not hold the XUEPCSEDIT key. The two keys are exclusive—the user may not hold both keys at the same time. If the user does not hold the OREPCSSITE key or holds the XUEPCSEDIT key, the system will not display the ePCS SITE ENABLE/DISABLE option.
***

**If needed after the initial installation, sites can enable or disable the entire site using the following steps:**
1.  Log in to the appropriate VistA account.
1.  Select the ePCS User Enable/Disable option. (OR EPCS SITE PARAMETER or to navigate to it, use these options: ORMGR\> PE CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) ...\> GP GUI Parameters\> DEA GUI ePCS Management Menu\> ePCS Site Enable/Disable).
1.  At the ENABLE EPCS prompt, type YES to enable or No to disable and press \<Enter\>.
***

##### PKISERVER.EXE

Another part of the system that must be set up is an application called PKISERVER.EXE, developed by KERNEL team. This application should be installed on a server (basically a computer with a static IP address so that CPRS can find it) for the authentication to happen when pharmacy finishes the order. PKISERVER.EXE must be installed in at least one location, but it can be installed in as many as three locations. After PKISERVER.EXE is installed, IRM or CAC staff must enter the Internet Protocol (IP) address for each location in the PKI Server field (\#53.1) in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (\#8989.3). This field can hold up to three (3) IP addresses separated by commas (for example: 101.01.999,102.02.999).
Installation of the PKIServer as an automatic service is performed using the PKIVerifyServerSetup application. On Windows 7 systems, the application should be installed by right-clicking on PKIVerifyServerSetup.exe and selecting Run As Administrator. This installation will add the PKIServer.exe to the C:\\Windows directory, and then add it as an automatic service and then start the service. If the service has been previously installed, it will stop the service, remove the service, and then replace the earlier version of PKIServer.exe before setting up and starting the service.
**Note:** If you look at services on the server or computer with the static IP address, the service name will be PKI_verify_services.
***

##### Configuring Users Permissions for Digital Signature

Another part of the digital signature feature or electronic prescription of controlled substances (ePCS) is that of setting up the specific permission and attributes for the user. The Kernel team created the ePCSDataEntryForPresciber.exe application to set up the items necessary according to DEA regulations to enable or authorize users to electronically order and sign controlled substances.
To ensure that a user is authorized to digitally sign an outpatient controlled substance order, CPRS checks these attributes that are shown in the application:
-   Authorized to write orders (FILE 200 FIELD 53.1)
-   Subject Alternative Name (SAN): For VA employees, the SAN is usually the VA outlook e-mail address (if they have one) that is on the Smart or PIV card. However rotating staff or other providers may have a different format. The SAN information can be found on the card. See explanation on How to Find a User’s SAN below.
-   Facility DEA number that is used in conjunction with the prescriber’s VA number (FILE 4 FIELD 52)
-   Prescriber VA DEA number (FILE 200 FIELD 53.3)
-   Prescriber DEA Expiration Date
-   The schedules for which a prescriber can prescribe (FILE 200 FIELDS 55.1-55.6)
***

**WARNING:** If any user has been assigned any pharmacy schedules (any of the boxes have been checked at all) and then all checks are removed and the Update button is selected, the next time the user tries to order a medication, their information—including their DEA number—will be erased from the system.
To use this executable, a user must be assigned the XUEPCSEDIT key. To keep the two functions of assigning privileges and ordering controlled substances separate, the user who uses the ePCS Data Entry For Prescriber GUI application must not have the ORES key. When the keys are assigned a check will occur to make sure that both key are not assigned to the same user.
If a provider already has some of this information, it will display when the user selects the provider’s name. For example, if they are already authorized to write medication orders, the check box will be checked. If the user already has a DEA number, the DEA number will display and so forth.
###### How to Find a User’s SAN

The Subject Alternative Name or SAN for a user is found on the smart card. Below is an example of how to find the SAN. Normally, users can link their own PIV cards the first time they try to order outpatient controlled substance medication orders. However, sometimes something prevents this from occurring and the SAN on the card needs to be checked.
**Note:** For VA employees, the SAN is most often the same as their VA.GOV email address. If this does not work, someone at the site will have to examine the Digital Signing Certificate on their PIV card using ActivClient. See the example below:
**Steps needed to prepare for assigning the SAN**
1.  Open ActivClient.
***

![Screen capture of the main ActivClient window.](media/0755f7b870ded99dfc63f951fc0e3366.png)
1.  Double click on ‘My Certificates’
![Screen capture that shows the ActivClient windows with the my certificates area selected.](media/50704b2446be24007371c8a6136192cc.png)
1.  Select the “Digital Signature Key”.
***

![This screen capture shows the ActivClient dialog with the My Certificate properties tab showing. It shows who the certificate was issued to, whom the certificate was issued by, the valid dates, the email address, the purpose, and the Friendly name.](media/3a204f6d56aa5ba88946ad22c1d7cc91.png)
1.  Select the ‘Advanced’ Tab:
![This screen capture shows the ActivClient dialog with the My Certificate advanced tab displayed. On the Advanced tab is where the Subject Alternative Name or SAN can be found. The person setting up the user may need to know exactly how this is spelled.](media/0e78cb87895371ecc850608c6fc04be9.png)
***

Use this information to populate the SUBJECT ALTERNATIVE NAME through the Data Entry for ePrescribing of Controlled Substances application., which puts the information in file \#200.
The user can use the ePCS Data Entry for Prescriber tool to set up the subject alternative name for the remaining people who will use the tool or place outpatient controlled substance orders.
***
##### A New Key to Enter ePCS Data

To use the Data Entry for e-Prescribing Controlled Substances dialog, a user must be assigned the XUEPCSEDIT key through the normal key allocation process in VistA.
**Note:** The user may not be assigned both the XUEPCSEDIT key and ORES key at the same time. This is a simple security measure so that the person assigning permission may not also write medication orders.
***

##### Reports to Identify Providers that Need DEA Information Updates

There are several options to help the person setting up providers with the items needed to electronically prescribe outpatient controlled substances through CPRS. Authorized users can get to these options using the DEA GUI ePCS Management Menu. The full path to this menu is as shown below:

***

The user may not see all of these options based on what keys the user holds. The two options that help the user check on users’ characteristics for ePCS are
-   Check Provider ePCS Configuration
-   ePCS Data Validation Reports
***

###### Check Provider ePCS Configuration

This option enables the user to check providers configuration one provider at a time. After evaluation of the items necessary to write outpatient controlled substances orders, it will either display that the provider is authorized and can write order, or it will display what the user is lacking.
A change was made to this report to better reflect the condition of providers attempting to sign. Specifically, the report previously show providers who had an expired DEA number but had a valid VA number as “not allowed” to prescribe, which was not correct.
See examples below:

This report identifies all users with similar VA numbers. To identify
similar numbers, the software builds a temporary index. First, it removes all
non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation and spaces) from the user's
VA number, then changes all letters to uppercase, and finally adds the VA
number to the temporary index. It then uses that index to build a list of
similar or duplicate numbers. For example, kc123, KC 123, and KC-123 are
considered similar.

After logging in, the user needs to select a prescriber.
**To select a prescriber, use these steps:**
1.  Select the Select Provider button by either tabbing to the button and pressing \<Enter\> or click on the button.
1.  In the Look Up Utility dialog, select Find.
***

![P7619\#yIS1](media/08e50592390590c966e015d1069a8b36.png)
The Look Up Utility dialog lists the providers in the system. Users can scroll through the list or use the find button to search for a name.
***

1.  In the Find… dialog, type part or all of the prescriber’s name in the and select OK.
![In the Find... dialog, the user can enter part of a provider's name to look them up. In this example, cprsprovider has been entered.](media/3d04f1c6253b7c2ae9a54a4e21b6d383.png)
***

1.  If a list displays with multiple possible name, find the correct name, select it, and press \<Enter\> or click OK.
![Look Up Utility with CPRSPROVIDER,EIGHT selected.](media/40abd161e6350ca32b193fe84ec3af47.png)
If there is more than one matching names in the system, the Look Up Utility displays a list of possible matches.
***

After the prescriber’s name is selected, the dialog displays any information that is available in VistA, such as in the screen capture below:
![Some of the remaining fields populate once the prescriber's name is selected. In this example, User's Alternative Name, DEA \#, and DEA Expiration Date have been filled in. ](media/44639e69e89aca16fdf851fc4396214b.png)
Once the user selects the prescriber to edit, the rest of the fields show information previously entered. The user can now edit this prescriber’s information.
##### Overview of Digital Signature Process

When an outpatient medication order is placed, CPRS uses an RPC call to a new Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) API to find out the drug’s exact Controlled Substance Federal Schedule type (1, 2, 2n, 3, 3n, 4, 5). For all orders for controlled substances except schedule 1, CPRS will store an indicator in the orders file to require a digital signature.
CPRS builds and stores an order’s external text. The following information is included in the external text as required by DEA:
-   Date of prescription
-   Full name and address of patient
-   Drug name
-   Drug strength (used in directions)
-   Drug dosage form (used in directions)
-   Drug quantity prescribed
-   Direction for use
-   Practitioner’s name
-   Practitioner’s address
-   Practitioner’s (DEA) registration number
-   Signature (in this case the digital signature of the physician)
***

When the clinician attempts to sign the orders, the normal electronic signature process within CPRS first takes place. Then, for Controlled Substance medication orders, the clinician must check the check box in from of each order to be signed and then insert the smart card (PIV card) if it is not already in the card reader and enter the PIN.
The above information is used to create a hash that is wrapped in a signed document and stored in VistA. CPRS stores the hash in the ORDERS ACTION subfile (100.008) of the ORDERS file (100). When pharmacy attempts to finish the order, it gathers the same information listed above and sends it to the PKISERVER.exe application running on an external server. PKISERVER.exe creates a hash based on that information and compares it to what is stored in VistA to see if the hashes match. If the hash values differ then the prescription cannot be filled.
In addition, the certificate that was used to sign the hash is checked to determine whether it has been revoked in the time between prescribing and being filled. If it has been revoked, the order cannot be filled.
###### User Messages for Possible Reasons the Digital Signature Failed

When CPRS tries to validate whether a provider can place or sign an order for controlled substances, several error messages that fall into four basic categories might be displayed to the user during the ordering or signature process:
-   invalid DEA number
-   not authorized to prescribe in Federal Schedule *x* (where *x* is the schedule number that the user is not authorized to write orders for)
-   expired DEA number
***

##### Notifications Sent to Users for Other Problems

For the following problems, CPRS sends a notification to the provider:
-   Hash mismatches (the pharmacist would see this error when the information from the original order and the information in pharmacy during finishing does not match exactly)
-   Revoked certificate
-   Expired certificate
##### Archiving Controlled Substances Prescription Data

When a provider writes an outpatient controlled substance medication order, CPRS will archive the information to file ORPA(101.52 – ORDER DEA ARCHIVE INFO FILE. This archive is required by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and will contain the prescription information from the time the order was signed. Pharmacy will run reports using data from this file.
**Warning**: Do NOT edit this file either manually or using Fileman. This data is to remain exactly as it was when the order was signed.
### Order Flagging and Unflagging Set Up

Order flagging and unflagging has some additional features that Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) can configure using the GUI Order Flagging/Unflagging Setup menu.

***

### Consults Order Dialog

#### Parameters

On the Consults tab, the “New Consult” button, as well as the “New…” menu option, can be linked to a specified order dialog, quick order, or order menu, resulting in behavior identical to ordering via the Orders tab. As exported, clicking on the button will display the generic consults ordering dialog. By changing the value of the parameter ORWDX NEW CONSULT, this default behavior can be modified and customized by SYSTEM, LOCATION, and USER.
This parameter cannot be directly changed using the GUI, and must be modified using the General Parameter Tools menu options. Any existing order dialog, quick order, or order menu can be assigned to the parameter, at any of the three levels. A common practice is to assign the same consults order menu to the button as is used on the Orders tab. This provides consistent functionality, and two ways to access the same lists of quick orders.
There is currently no available way to disable the button entirely. A common method of effectively disabling the buttons is to create an order menu consisting of only a text entry. That entry should advise the user that ordering is only available via the Orders tab. Assign that menu to the appropriate parameter, and the menu text will be displayed to the user when the button is selected.
#### Variables

The following variables, if set to a non-zero value in the entry action of either an order menu or an individual quick order, will cause the corresponding prompt to be disabled and not answerable in the GUI order dialog. If a particular quick order contains a conflicting value, the value stored in the quick order will take precedence.
-   GMRCNOPD Disables the “Provisional Diagnosis” prompt. If this variable is not set, logic in the consults package setup for the selected service will determine the behavior of this prompt.
-   GMRCNOAT Disables the “Attention:” prompt.
-   GMRCREAF Disables the “Reason for Request” edit box. If this variable is not set, logic in the consults package setup for the selected service will determine the behavior of this prompt.
***

#### Procedures Order Dialog

##### Parameters

On the Consults tab, the “New Procedure” button, as well as the “New…” menu option, (Action \| New) can be linked to a specified order dialog, quick order, or order menu, resulting in behavior identical to ordering via the Orders tab. As exported, clicking on the button will display the generic procedures ordering dialog. By changing the value of the parameter ORWDX NEW PROCEDURE, this default behavior can be modified and customized by SYSTEM, LOCATION, and USER.
This parameter cannot be directly changed using the GUI, and must be modified using the General Parameter Tools menu options. Any existing order dialog, quick order, or order menu can be assigned to the parameter, at any of the three levels. A common practice is to assign the same procedures order menu to the button as is used on the Orders tab. This provides consistent functionality, and two ways to access the same lists of quick orders.
There is currently no available way to disable the button entirely. A common method of effectively disabling the button is to create an order menu consisting of only a text entry. That entry should advise the user that ordering is only available via the Orders tab. Assign that menu to the parameter, and the menu text will be displayed to the user when the button is selected.
##### Variables

The following variables, if set to a non-zero value in the entry action of either an order menu or an individual quick order, will cause the corresponding prompt to be disabled and not answerable in the GUI order dialog. If a particular quick order contains a conflicting value, the value stored in the quick order will take precedence.
-   GMRCNOPD Disables the “Provisional Diagnosis” prompt. If this variable is not set, logic in the consults package setup for the service associated with the selected procedure will determine the behavior of this prompt.
-   GMRCNOAT Disables the “Attention:” prompt.
-   GMRCREAF Disables the “Reason for Request” edit box. If this variable is not set, logic in the consults package setup for the service associated with the selected procedure will determine the behavior of this prompt.
***

#### Lab Order Dialog
##### Parameters

All laboratory parameters used by the CPRS GUI are set via options in the Lab package, and not by editing the parameter values directly.
The value of the following parameters determines whether routine lab collections are performed on the corresponding day of the week. They can be set only at the SYSTEM level:
-   LR COLLECT MONDAY
-   LR COLLECT TUESDAY
-   LR COLLECT WEDNESDAY
-   LR COLLECT THURSDAY
-   LR COLLECT FRIDAY
-   LR COLLECT SATURDAY
-   LR COLLECT SUNDAY
***

If the parameter LR IGNORE HOLIDAYS is set to TRUE, also only possible at the SYSTEM level, then the lab at this site collects on holidays, and the holiday status of a date is ignored when determining routine collection times for that date.
If the parameter LR EXCEPTED LOCATIONS is set to TRUE for an ordering location, then weekend and holiday collection times are never skipped for that location. The same routine lab collection times are available on weekends and holidays for these locations as for any other day of the week.
The parameter LR PHLEBOTOMY COLLECTION is read to determine the routine lab collect times that will appear in the “Collection Time” combo box, and in the selection box on the calendar display window that appears if “Future” is selected as a Lab Collect time. On the “Future” calendar screen, only those routine lab collect times for the selected date are shown, and only those for that date which are not already beyond the defined cutoff time for each collection. The parameter’s value is set by DIVISION and SYSTEM, and is based on values in the LABORATORY SITE file (\#69.9).
The parameter LR DEFAULT TYPE QUICK determines the default collection type for the basic lab order dialog, and for quick orders where no collection type is otherwise defined, either by a dialog response, or by setting a value in the LRFZX variable (see below). This parameter is set by LOCATION.
The parameter LR MAX DAYS CONTINUOUS determines the total length of time that can be covered by the time span entered for a recurrent test. The response to the “How Long?” prompt is evaluated, either as a number of days or a number of times, and the total duration of the ordered test is compared against the parameter value to determine its validity. The parameter can be set by SYSTEM and LOCATION, and values can range from 1 to 370 days.
The parameter LR LAB COLLECT FUTURE defines how far in the future a lab-collected test can be ordered. The start date of the test cannot be further in the future than the number of days defined in the parameter. The parameter can be set by LOCATION, DIVISION, and SYSTEM, and values can range from 1 to 370 days.
##### Variables

The following variables, if set to a value in the entry action of either an order menu or an individual quick order, will cause the corresponding prompt to be pre-answered in the GUI order dialog. If set for a menu, all lab tests on that menu will be affected by the defined value. If a particular quick order contains a conflicting value, either as a dialog response or as an entry action redefinition of the variable, the value stored in the quick order will take precedence.
| LRFZX   | Defines the default collection type for the menu or quick order. Possible values include “LC”, “WC”, “SP”, or “I”. These correspond to “Lab Collect”, “Ward Collect”, “Send Patient to Lab”, and “Immediate Collect”, respectively. See discussion of parameter LR DEFAULT TYPE QUICK above. |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LRFSAMP | Defines the default collection sample for the menu or quick order. The value is a pointer to the COLLECTION SAMPLE file (\#62).                                                                                                                                                              |
| LRFSPEC | Defines the default specimen for the menu or quick order. The value is a pointer to the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (\#61).                                                                                                                                                                        |
| LRFDATE | Defines the default collection date/time for the menu or quick order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| LRFURG  | Defines the default urgency for the menu or quick order. The value is a pointer to the URGENCY file (\#62.05).                                                                                                                                                                               |
| LRFSCH  | Defines the default schedule for the menu or quick order. The value is a pointer to the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (\#51.1).                                                                                                                                                               |

##### “Other” as a Choice for Collection Sample or Specimen

The “Other” selection for these items is available for any lab test with the "MI" (microbiology) subscript, for all users. Additionally, for users holding the LRLAB key, the “Other” selection is available for all lab tests, regardless of subscript.
##### Combining Lab Orders

When an order is sent to the Lab package an attempt is made to combine the request with any active Lab order number for the same:
-   Patient
-   Time
-   Collection Type
-   Specimen
-   Provider
***

The logic for combining orders is:
-   Don’t add to collected orders.
-   Don’t add if any part of the order is collected.
-   Don’t add to a combined order
-   Don’t add if collection types are different
-   If Collection type equals LC (Lab Collect):
-   Collection times must match exactly
If Collection type does not equal LC (is WC, SP, IM):

-   Collection times must be within 600 seconds (10 minutes) of each other
-   If the time is not exact (2980724), orders will be still be compared for 600 second limit
Don’t add if the order has been canceled
Duplicate tests (entered in the same session) are allowed to combine to the same lab order number only if the test specimens are different. Duplicate tests (entered in the same session), with the same test specimen get their own distinct lab order number.
Tests that are defined ‘not to combine’ will get their own unique Lab order number
Order is combined at the specimen level (\^LRO(69,LRODT,1,LRSN)) if the following match:
-   DUZ
-   Sample
-   Provider
-   Location
-   Specimen
***

Order is combined at Order number level (\^LRO(69,”C”,LRORD)) if the following match:

-   Sample
-   Specimen
***

##### Immediate Collect Issues

When ordering a lab test as “Immediate Collect”, there is a minimum lead time that is required by the lab, as defined in the Lab package. If the current time plus this minimum lead time is entered as the collect time for the order, it is possible that while making other selections on the order dialog, the minimum lead time originally selected will become insufficient as time passes. To prevent this from happening, the requested time is reevaluated on acceptance of the order, and is adjusted accordingly if the minimum required time has not been met.
##### Canceling Lab Orders

You should configure auto-DC rules to manage how lab orders are automatically discontinued. For more information, see the  [Automatically Discontinuing Orders (Auto-DC Rules)](#give-additional-dose-now-option-on-the-inpatient-medications-form) topic.
**Note**: Previously, automatic cancellation of lab orders was controlled by the CANCEL ON ADMIT, CANCEL ON DISCHARGE, and CANCEL ON SPECIALTY TRANSFER fields in the Laboratory Site File (\#69.9). It is recommended that you leave these fields null and use auto-DC rules.

#### Imaging Order Dialog
##### Parameters

The parameter RA REQUIRE DETAILED controls whether restrictions are placed on imaging procedures orderable based on procedure type (possible procedure types are: Detailed, Series, Parent, Broad). If this parameter is set to “0”, users are allowed to order any imaging procedure regardless of type. If set to “1”, users are not allowed to select “Broad” type imaging procedures. These “Broad” procedures will not appear in the selection list. This parameter may be set by DIVISION and SYSTEM.
The parameter RA SUBMIT PROMPT controls whether the “Submit To:” combo box is enabled or disabled. The Imaging Location entered with the order determines where the Imaging Request form will print (IRM can assign each Imaging Location in the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine package a request printer). If this parameter is set to 0, the Imaging Request form will not be printed. If this parameter is set to 1, the system will first attempt to automatically determine the Imaging Location, enter it as the default in the combo box, and then disable the combo box. If the automatic attempt fails, then the combo box will be enabled. If there is more than one Imaging Location for the current imaging type (examples of imaging types selectable when ordering imaging procedures are Nuclear Med, Ultrasound, General Radiology, etc.), the automatic attempt will fail and the combo box will be enabled. If there is only one possible Imaging Location for the current imaging type, the system will automatically default to that location, and the combo box will be disabled. This parameter may be set by DIVISION and SYSTEM.
#### Allergies Dialog
##### Files Used for Lookup

A list of causative agents matching the search term entered by the user is returned from the following files:
-   GMR ALLERGIES (\#120.82)
-   Drug Ingredients (\#50.416)
-   VA Drug Class (\#50.605)
-   National Drug File (Generic Name)
-   National Drug File (Trade Name)
***

##### Top 10 Symptoms List

The top ten symptoms list is retrieved from the GMR ALLERGY SITE PARAMETERS file (\#120.84). These ten symptoms are presented at the top of the symptoms selection box, with the remaining available symptoms appearing below a separator line. These remaining items are retrieved from the SIGN/SYMPTOMS file (\#120.83).
## Notes Tab

### Criteria Used to Determine Notes Shown in List

The parameter ORCH CONTEXT NOTES contains information used to limit or customize the list of notes displayed to the user. This parameter is used by both the CPRS GUI and List Manager versions. It can be set by SYSTEM and by USER. The parameter’s value is a semicolon-delimited string, the pieces of which contain the following:
a;b;c;d;e;f;g;h;I;j;k;l Example: **T-90;T;1;1329;20;1;A;1;1;T;B;test**
***

a Begin date
b End date
c Status (pointer to the TIU STATUS file (\#8925.6))
d Author (pointer to the NEW PERSON file (\#200))
e Occurrence Limit - The number of notes actually shown by default is determined by using the Occurrence Limit from the parameter, and then, if not present, the NUMBER OF NOTES ON REV SCREEN from TIU preferences (see below).
f If present and non-zero, show subject in notes list.
g Sort notes in list view by visit date (D), author (A), title (T), location (L), or subject (s).
h If present and non-zero, sort tree view chronologically, otherwise reverse chronologically.
i If present and non-zero, sort list view chronologically, otherwise reverse chronologically.
j Group notes in tree view by visit date (D), author (A), title (T), or location (L).
k Field to search for keyword in (l). Subject (S), Title (T), or Both (B).
l Keyword to search for in fields defined in (k).
***

The user-level value for this parameter can be set using the “Custom View” menu and saving the selected options as the default.

### Document List Management

Also available from the TIU PERSONAL PREFERENCES menu is an option called DOCUMENT LIST MANAGEMENT. This option allows a user to select a default document title and to create personal lists of commonly used titles.
The first option allows the creation of a default title for a given document class. Within each document class (Progress Notes, Consults, Discharge Summary, etc) it is possible for a user to select a default title that will be pre-selected whenever creating a new document of that class. If there is a default title for the user, and all other information necessary to create the note is already present, the note properties dialog will be bypassed, and the note editor will appear immediately on clicking the “New Note” button or menu item. This behavior can be changed using the parameter ORWOR VERIFY NOTE TITLE. This parameter is only used in the GUI, and can be set by USER, DIVISION, and SYSTEM. If set to TRUE, the note properties dialog will always display, regardless of the presence of a default title for the user. The default title will be pre-selected in the title list, but the user will be required to click OK to exit the dialog, thereby verifying that the default title is the correct one to be used.
The second option allows the creation of personal title lists. When creating a new note belonging to a given class, the user will be asked to select a title belonging to that class. On the Notes tab, the class is usually PROGRESS NOTES, while on the Consults tab it is CONSULTS. On the Discharge Summary tab, it is DISCHARGE SUMMARY. For any particular class, it may be useful to only have to choose from among a few highly specific titles (e.g., a pulmonologist entering a Progress Note may wish to choose from a short list of three or four titles related to pulmonary function, or pulmonary disease). Rather than presenting a list of hundreds of unrelated titles, the list named and defined here will be presented at the very top of the list of titles. In the event that a title is needed which doesn’t appear on this short list, the remaining available titles are listed below the short list, separated by a horizontal bar.
***

### Consult Completion Via the Notes Tab

If a CONSULTS class document title is selected when creating a new note, a list of consults is presented for linking to the note. A document in this class requires linking to a consult request during creation of the document. Consults are included in the selection list if:
-   They were ordered within the number of days specified by the parameter GMRC CONSULT LIST DAYS. This parameter is used to allow a site to set the number of days that will be searched backwards for a Consult to be associated with a Note. A default parameter of 365 days will be set at the Package Level.
-   The user can complete the consult based on his/her access level to the service of the consult, as determined via settings in the Consults package.
-   The consult’s status allows completion via a TIU note.
### Autosaving Parameter

The parameter ORWOR AUTOSAVE NOTE allows setting of the time interval at which notes in progress will be automatically saved to the V*ist*A server. Its value can be set by SYSTEM and USER, and contains the number of seconds between successive auto-saves. The exported value is 180 seconds (every 3 minutes). Local system performance issues may affect the optimum value for a given site or user.
### Spell Checking

With the CPRS GUI, it is possible to do a spelling check of TIU documents, provided MS Word has been installed on the workstation, and spelling is enabled. CPRS uses the same dictionaries and settings as are in effect for MS Word.
These nine files have been made available as the CPRS Spelling Dictionary supplement:
-   CPRSlex-ab.dic
-   CPRSlex-c.dic
-   CPRSlex-caps.dic
-   CPRSlex-de.dic
-   CPRSlex-fh.dic
-   CPRSlex-ilwz.dic
-   CPRSlex-mo.dic
-   CPRSlex-pr.dic
-   CPRSlex-sv.dic
***

These files contain about 50,000 words from the VistA Lexicon. They are one way to provide medical words for CPRS to check. Local use of them is optional, and does not supersede other methods of providing a medical vocabulary.
You may download dictionary files from the CPRS National Development website at
<https://vaww.va.gov/cprs/cprs_spellcheck_files.asp>
and then clicking on *Spellcheck zip file*.
To use these files:
1.  Save the files into the *\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Proof\\* directory or whichever Windows directory holds the files with “.lex” and “.dic” extensions.
1.  From Word for Windows, select **Tools \| Options…**
1.  Select the Spelling & Grammar tab.
1.  Click the **Dictionaries…** button. The nine dictionary files are listed in the Custom dictionaries window.
1.  Make sure all nine files names have a check beside them.
1.  Click **OK** until all dialogs are closed.
Also, while on the Spelling & Grammar tab, make sure that the following items are checked:
-   Check spelling as you type
-   Always suggest corrections
***

Ignore Internet and file addresses, and be sure that the following items are NOT checked:
-   Hide spelling error in this document
-   Suggest from main dictionary only
-   Ignore words in UPPERCASE
-   Ignore words with numbers
***

To Use the spelling checker in the CPRS GUI, create a TIU document. Position the cursor at the beginning of the TIU document. Right click in the document and choose Check Spelling. The Spell Checker feature in Microsoft Word will be activated, and will operate exactly as it does in Word.
***

### Additional Documentation

For additional information related to the implementation of business rules, user classes, the Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU), creation and use of boilerplate text, and TIU objects, please consult the documentation already available for the Text Integration Utility (TIU) and ASU packages.
### Populating the Encounter Forms

The Encounter Form is populated from AICS Encounter Forms on file for each location, and from the current patient record.
CPRS relies on the existence of well-formed AICS forms for each location. Data is retrieved from the form for the currently selected location to fill in the information in the top half of the encounter form. Eight of the 10 tabs shown across the top of the Windows form reflect the contents of this AICS form.
The GAF tab will appear when the currently selected location is a mental health clinic. The current criteria for this determination is a stop code that starts with a “5”, excluding the following codes: 526, 527, 528, 530, 536, 537, 542, 546, 579.
Vitals tab is entirely populated from the patient record.
Visit Type, Diagnosis, Procedures, Immunizations, Skin Tests, Patient Education, Health Factors, and Exams each correspond to a TYPE OF DATA used to populate lists in the AICS encounter form.
The following TYPE OF DATA values create entries that appear in the GUI Encounter Form:
| TYPE OF DATA Name                | Associated Tab |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| SELECT VISIT TYPE CPT PROCEDURES | Visit Type     |
| SELECT ICD-9 DIAGNOSIS CODES     | Diagnosis      |
| SELECT CPT PROCEDURE CODES       | Procedures     |
| SELECT IMMUNIZATIONS             | Immunizations  |
| SELECT SKIN TESTS                | Skin Tests     |
| SELECT EDUCATION TOPICS          | Patient Ed     |
| SELECT HEALTH FACTORS            | Health Factors |
| SELECT EXAMS                     | Exams          |
All other TYPE OF DATA values have no effect on the GUI Encounter Form.
***

If the associated TYPE OF DATA is missing from the Encounter Form, then that tab is not populated.
The TYPE OF DATA is selected while defining a new list while using the ED (Edit Form) option of the Edit Encounter Forms menu as in the following example:

-   SELECT HEALTH FACTORS
-   SELECT EXAMS
***

For example, the Procedures tab is populated from a list with the TYPE OF DATA set to SELECT CPT PROCEDURE CODES as follows:
***
![The Procedures tab of the Encounter form has three sections or panes. The first pane shows the sections of procedures, the section subdivides the section shows procedure names, and the third shows the modifiers for that procedure.](media/6e933ce57ddaa2cadabba49c1173ea85.jpg)
The items in the first pane correspond to groups within each list.
The items in the Section Name pane correspond to selections within the group that is currently selected. In the Visit Type tab, this pane takes on the name of the section selected.
Only one tab has a Modifiers pane, the Procedures tab. The Modifiers pane is populated with appropriate modifiers based on selections in the Section Name pane. Pre-check modifiers are specified while editing the encounter form. Responding to the CPT MODIFIER prompt in the Add or Edit Selection command does this. This is only applicable while filling in the group contents of lists with TYPE OF DATA set to SELECT CPT PROCEDURE CODES.
***

### Encounter Parameters

#### Prompting for encounter Entry When Signing a Note

Users are never asked to enter encounter information if:
1.  The encounter date is for a date in the future.
1.  The encounter location is a non-count clinic.
1.  The encounter is for a scheduled appointment and that appointment has been canceled or is a no-show.
If none of the above conditions apply, the ORWPCE ASK ENCOUNTER UPDATE parameter determines when encounter information should be requested when signing a note. To fully understand this parameter, the user needs to understand how CPRS interprets the terms “Primary” and “Data Needed.”
##### Primary

Is the current user the primary provider for this encounter? If no primary encounter provider has been determined, CPRS attempts to identify one. All possible sources of encounter providers are filtered based on active person class, unless associated with a historical visit. The steps taken in identifying a possible primary encounter provider are (in order):
1.  Look at the value of the TIU parameter DEFAULT PRIMARY PROVIDER. This parameter has three possible settings:
-   NONE, DON’T PROMPT
-   DEFAULT, BY LOCATION
-   AUTHOR (IF PROVIDER)
***

1.  If this parameter is set to 1, a possible primary provider is identified as the default provider assigned to the given encounter location. This is determined by looking at the DEFAULT PROVIDER field (sub field \#.02) of the PROVIDER multiple (Field \#2600) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (\#44). If the current user is the primary encounter provider for the given location, that user is automatically assigned as the primary encounter provider.
1.  If there is still no primary encounter provider defined, CPRS looks at the provider identified with the primary CPRS visit. This is the same provider shown with the current visit, in the patient information bar. If this provider does not have an active person class, or has not been defined, the current user is substituted (provided they have an active person class). CPRS then asks if this user is the primary encounter provider.
1.  If there is still no primary encounter provider defined, the TIU parameter DEFAULT PRIMARY PROVIDER is again reviewed. If a provider is identified, either from the encounter location or the author, the user is asked if this individual is the primary encounter provider.
##### Data Needed

The ORWPCE ASK ENCOUNTER UPDATE parameter uses the term “Data Needed” to represent the fact the PCE data has been requested for the given note title. This is determined by looking at the following criteria:
1.  If the date of the encounter is in the future, no PCE data is needed.
1.  If the service category is not “A” (Ambulatory), “I” (In Hospital), or “T” (Telecommunications), no PCE data is needed.
1.  If the title specific TIU document parameter SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY is set to YES, no PCE data is needed.
1.  If the encounter is a stand-alone visit, PCE data is needed.
1.  If the title specific TIU document parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS is set to YES, PCE data is needed.
1.  Otherwise, PCE data is not needed.
1.  If it is determined that PCE data is needed for a given encounter, existing PCE entries are examined to determine exactly what is missing. A diagnosis and procedure are always required. Service connected information is required if the title specific TIU document parameter FORCE RESPONSE TO EXPOSURES is set to YES. If all needed data has already been entered, PCE data is not needed for the encounter.
##### Signing the Note

The ORWPCE ASK ENCOUNTER UPDATE parameter can be set at the user, location, service, division and system levels. When signing a note, this parameter is used to determine if the user should be prompted to enter encounter information, based on one of the possible settings:
0 Primary/Data Needed (Default Setting) - The user will be asked to enter encounter information if they are the primary encounter provider, and if data is needed for the encounter.
1 Primary/Outpatient - The user will be asked to enter encounter information if they are the primary encounter provider, and the service category is “A” (Ambulatory), “I” (In Hospital), or “T” (Telecommunications).
2 Primary Always - The user will be asked to enter encounter information on all encounters, if they are the primary encounter provider.
3 Data Needed - All users will be asked to enter encounter information if data is needed for the encounter.
4 Outpatient - All users will be asked to enter encounter information, if the service category is “A” (Ambulatory), “I” (In Hospital), or “T” (Telecommunications).
5 Always - All users will be asked to enter encounter information on all encounters.
6 Never – The user will never be asked to enter encounter information when signing the note.
7 Disable - The user will never be asked to enter encounter information when signing the note, and the encounter button will be disabled, even when a note is being edited.
##### Forcing PCE Entry

Once it has been determined that the user should be asked to enter encounter information, a dialog box is displayed, specifying any missing encounter data. If data is not needed, or if the user is not the primary encounter provider, the user will be given “Yes” and “No” buttons that can be used to determine if they want to enter encounter information. Pressing the “Yes” button will allow encounter information to be entered, followed by a continuation of the note signing process. Pressing the “No” button will bypass entry of encounter information, going directly to a continuation of the note signing process.
When data is needed, and the user is the primary encounter provider, the ORWPCE FORCE PCE ENTRY parameter will be checked to determine if the user must fill out all missing encounter information before being allowed to sign the note. If this parameter is set to YES, the user will be prompted “You must enter the encounter information before you can sign the note”, and given “OK” and “Cancel” buttons. Pressing the “Cancel” button will terminate the note signing process, resulting in an unsigned note (the user will be warned that the note was not signed). If this parameter is set to NO, the user will be asked if they want to enter encounter information, and will be given “Yes”, “No” and “Cancel” buttons. Again, pressing the “Cancel” button will terminate the note signing process, resulting in an unsigned note. Pressing the “No” button will allow the note to be signed.
When data is needed, the user is the primary encounter provider, and they go on to enter encounter information, continued checks will be made when exiting the encounter form to determine if there is any missing encounter data. If all missing information has been entered, the user will continue on with the note signing process. If there is missing encounter information, the user will continue to be prompted to enter it, regardless of the ORWPCE FORCE PCE ENTRY setting.
#### Availability of the Encounter Button

The ORWPCE ANYTIME ENCOUNTERS parameter allows encounter entry even when a note is not being edited. This allows for encounter entry for dictated notes, as well as updating encounters for notes that have already been signed. This parameter can be set at the User, Service, Division, and System levels. When set, the encounter button will appear on the Notes tab just above the New Note button. When pressing the encounter button (and no note is being edited) the user may be asked to specify the encounter to edit, either an encounter associated with the current visit, or the encounter associated with the currently selected note.
#### Managing Encounter Checkout

The default behavior of any encounter entered through the CPRS GUI is to automatically check out the encounter. Many sites have a workflow environment where this behavior is problematic. By setting the ORWPCE DISABLE AUTO CHECKOUT parameter to yes, encounters entered through the CPRS GUI will only check out if the encounter has a diagnosis, procedure or provider specified for the encounter. Other encounter entries, such as those containing only health factors or education topics, will not check out. With this parameter set, users will not be asked to enter a primary encounter provider when saving encounter information if there is no diagnosis, procedure or provider specified for that encounter. The ORWPCE DISABLE AUTO CHECKOUT parameter can be set at the User, Location, Service, Division, and System levels.
***
#### Restricting Encounter Form Entry of Encounter Data

Some types of encounter data can be restricted from entry within the encounter form. This may be needed when specific encounter information should only be entered through reminder dialogs. There are five parameters that allow specific encounter information to be excluded from the “Other” buttons on the encounter form tabs. These parameters are
-   ORWPCE EXCLUDE IMMUNIZATIONS
-   ORWPCE EXCLUDE SKIN TESTS
-   ORWPCE EXCLUDE PATIENT ED
-   ORWPCE EXCLUDE HEALTH FACTORS
-   ORWPCE EXCLUDE EXAMS
***

These multi-valued parameters can all be set at the User, Location, Service, Division, and System levels.
#### Forcing Type of Visit Selection

Normally, when first entering the Visit Type tab of the encounter form, the first Type of Visit defined for that encounter location is automatically selected. For some clinics that see a wide variety of different patient types, this behavior leads to user error where the wrong type of visit is selected. The ORWPCE DISABLE AUTO VISIT TYPE parameter can be set to force the selection of a Type of Visit before allowing selection of an E&M code.
***

### Women’s Health Note Document Class

For Women’s Health Notes, there must be a Women’s Health Note document class created in TIU for use in CPRS. Sites should verify if this Document Class exists. This document class should have been created before the CPRS v31b installation.
If it does not exist on your system, you must create the document class. The name of the document class should be WOMEN’S HEALTH NOTES document class. The instructions for creating the document class are given below or users can find the information for creating a document class in the Text Integration Utilities (TIU).
If the WOMEN’S HEALTH NOTES document class does not exist at your site, use these steps to create it:
1.  In VistA, go to the **TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU**.
1.  Select **2 Document Definitions (Manager) …** and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select **3 Create Document Definitions…** and press \<Enter\>.
1.  Select the Class under which you will place the new Document Class and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Select Action prompt, select type CL (Class/DocumentClass) and press \<Enter\>.
1.  When prompted, type **Women’s Health Notes** for the new document class and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the Clincal Owner prompt, select the appropriate owner and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the STATUS prompt, press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the SEQUENCE prompt, type the appropriate sequence number and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the MNEMONIC prompt, type a mnemonic if desired and press \<Enter\>.
1.  At the MENU TEXT prompt, where it displays Women's Health Notes Replace, press \<Enter\>.
***

Below is an example of creating the WOMEN’S HEALTH NOTES document class. In this example, the new class is created under the PROGRESS NOTES class. The site may choose to place the new class underneath a different class; it does not matter where in the document hierarchy the WOMEN’S HEALTH NOTES document class exists.
This is a TEST account.

### Templates – Access, Storage and Maintenance

The Options menu of the Notes, Consults, and Discharge Summary tabs contains several menu items:
-   Edit Templates
-   Create New Template
-   Edit Shared Templates
-   Create New Shared Template
-   Edit Template Fields (discussed in the next section)
***

Although each of the first four menu items starts the Template Editor, not all of these menu options may be enabled.
#### Shared Template Editor Authority

Edit Shared Templates and Create New Shared Template are enabled for members of the CLINICAL COORDINATOR ASU user class. There is a way for sites to open up the editing of shared templates to users outside the CLINICAL COORDINATOR user class (perhaps creating a SHARED TEMPLATE EDITOR user class), but FileMan access is required. To do this, edit the Shared Templates entry in the TIU TEMPLATE file (\#8927). This should be the first item in the file (IEN \#1), but if, for some reason, it is not item \#1, look in the AROOT cross-reference, under the “ROOT” entry, for the Shared Templates IEN. For example:
**\^TIU(8927,”AROOT”,”ROOT”,1)**
The 1 here indicates IEN 1 is the Shared Templates folder.
Using FileMan, modify the value of the EDITOR CLASS field (.07) to point to the ASU user class allowed to edit shared templates. For example:
VA FileMan 22.0
Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: TIU TEMPLATE// 8927 TIU TEMPLATE (311 entries)
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// .07 EDITOR CLASS
THEN EDIT FIELD:

The Edit Templates and Create New Template menu items are always enabled for those authorized to edit shared templates. For other users, two TIU parameters determine personal template access. These parameters must be set using the XPAR EDIT PARAMETER option. For both of these parameters, valid settings are:
-   0 FULL ACCESS
-   1 READ ONLY
-   2 NO ACCESS
***

FULL ACCESS allows users to create and use their own personal templates (this is the default setting).
READ ONLY access allows the use of personal templates - i.e. any personal templates appear in the templates drawer, but editing personal templates is not allowed. This is in preparation for when Clinical Coordinators can modify user’s personal templates.
NO ACCESS prevents users from editing templates, or using personal templates. Shared templates can still be used (but not edited).
The parameters are:
-   TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS parameter can be set by User, Location, Service, Division, or System.
-   TIU TEMPLATE ACCESS BY CLASS parameter can hold ASU user classes.
***

Note that these two parameters work together, in the following precedence order:
| **Precedence** | **Parameter**                |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| USER           | TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS |
| USER CLASS     | TIU TEMPLATE ACCESS BY CLASS |
| LOCATION       | TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS |
| SERVICE        | TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS |
| DIVISION       | TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS |
| SYSTEM         | TIU PERSONAL TEMPLATE ACCESS |
There are two other places within the CPRS GUI where personal templates can be created or edited:
1.  When right clicking on a template in the templates drawer, menu items of Edit Templates and Create New Template are available. These menu items are only enabled for users with the authority to edit and create personal templates.
1.  When right clicking on a note, a popup menu appears with an option to Copy into New Template. This option will create a new personal template, and copy selected text into that template’s boilerplate. This menu option is only enabled when text has been selected in the note, and only for users with the authority to edit and create personal templates.
***

### Template Links to Reminder Dialogs

Reminder dialogs (not reminders) can be linked to templates, so that a reminder dialog can be selected from the templates drawer (reminder specific text will not be inserted into the note when the Finish button is pressed). This allows templates to create orders, enter encounter data, vitals, and do everything else that a reminder dialog can do. When a template is defined as a reminder dialog type, a list of reminder dialogs contained in the TIU TEMPLATE REMINDER DIALOGS parameter is then available in the template editor that can be linked to that reminder dialog. This multiple valued parameter can be set at the User, Service, Division, and System levels. Unlike most other parameters, this parameter is cumulative, in that reminder dialogs specified at any level can be linked to a template.
***

### Restricting Allowed Patient Data Objects within Templates

Clinical Application Coordinators can control which patient data objects are available in the templates drawer by inactivating or deleting undesired entries in the shared Patient Data Objects folder. Users that are allowed to create personal templates, however, have access to all active patient data objects. The TIU TEMPLATE PERSONAL OBJECTS parameter can be used to limit the patient data objects available in the template editor for users that cannot create shared templates. Only those objects specified in this parameter will appear in the Insert Patient Data Objects dialog of the template editor. If this parameter is blank, all patient data objects will be available. Note that this parameter is cumulative, in that entries at the User, Service, Division and System levels will all be available to the end user.
***

### Template Import/Export Utility

Following are several items of interest about the Template Import/Export utility available from the tools menu of the template editor:
-   Requires Internet Explorer version 5.0 or higher installed on the workstation.
-   Templates are imported at the location of the currently selected template, as if the New Template button had been pressed.
-   When exporting a template, all children templates are also exported, meaning that the entire Shared Templates or My Templates folders can be exported as a single file.
-   If the workstation has Microsoft Word 97 or higher installed, Word documents can be imported and converted to templates. Form Fields in a word document are converted to Template Fields, but there are usually formatting problems with the final result that need manual correction.
-   Template Fields in a template are exported with the template.
-   Patient Data Objects in a template are not exported with the template.
-   When importing a template that contains template fields, any existing template fields with the same name are compared with the fields being imported. If the field definitions differ, the imported fields are renamed (along with the field references in the imported template boilerplate).
-   Imported Template Fields are automatically saved after import, even if the imported template is not saved.
***

### Template Fields

The Options menu of the Notes, Consults, and Discharge Summary tabs contains one additional menu item, Edit Template Fields. This menu option is enabled based on the user classes entered in the TIU FIELD EDITOR CLASSES parameter. This multi-valued parameter contains a list of ASU user classes, and can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Users that are members of a user class specified in this parameter are allowed to edit template fields through this menu option. Other users will see this menu option disabled.
If you do not have authorization to edit template fields, you may see this dialog.

![If a user who does not have authorization to create new fields attempts to import a template that contains fields, CPRS displays this warning telling the user that if he or she proceeds and imports the template, the template will be imported, but the new fields will not be created. The user can then choose to proceed by selecting OK or stop by selecting Cancel.](media/a22cef5643fa947336324948aaada480.png)

The template field warning dialog.

If you press **OK**, the template will be imported without the new fields. If you press **Cancel**, the import process will be cancelled.

### Quick Order Auditing Templates

The OR Quick Order Audit Print option provides information about antimicrobial quick order usage. This report uses a Print template and a Sort template, both of which are named [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT REPORT]. The templates are used to display information from the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file (100.95). Both templates have the same name. The following provides information about the templates so that they can be modified or rebuilt as necessary by each site using the OR Quick Order Audit Print option.

### Reminder Options

Options: CPRS Reminder Configuration menu.
Options to activate clinical reminders for CPRS:
-   *CPRS Cover Sheet Reminder List* (parameter existed prior to this install) Use this option to enter reminders into the ORQQPX SEARCH ITEMS parameter. These reminders will be displayed on the CPRS cover sheet. You can also specify the sequence in which the reminders will be displayed. Set this for users, location, service, division, system, or package. Note that the ORQQPX SEARCH ITEMS parameter is ignored if the ORQQPX NEW REMINDER PARAMS parameter is set to YES (see New Reminders Parameters below.)
-   *CPRS Lookup Categories* Use this option to enter reminder categories that will be displayed in the Reminders Available tree list (right-click on reminder button) and the Reminder drawer (on the Notes Tab).
-   *Reminder GUI Resolution Active* Use this option to let users process reminders through the CPRS Notes or Consults tabs. This parameter can be set at the user, service, division, or system level. We recommend that you turn this on for a limited number of users to begin with until reminder dialogs are ready for use by clinicians. Users cannot use GUI resolution for a reminder until a reminder dialog is created for the reminder.
-   *Mental Health Dialogs Active* Use this option to turn this parameter on for the whole system to enable reminder resolution using mental health dialogs. This will make the appropriate mental health tests available to enter responses in the GUI resolution process. Other access settings include user and division.
-   *Progress Note Headers* Use this option to create a special header to distinguish the GUI resolution text generated for progress notes from other progress note text. The default header is “Clinical Reminder Activity.” Set this for users, location, service, division, system, or package.
-   *New Reminder Parameters* Use this option to activate cover sheet reminder retrieval from a new set of parameters. These parameters, ORQQPX COVER SHEET REM CLASSES and ORQQPX COVER SHEET REMINDERS contain coded information and should not be edited manually. See the New Cover Sheet Reminder List section for more information on setting up these parameters.
#### CPRS Reminder Configuration Menu

The options to maintain reminder categories and to implement reminders within CPRS are on this menu (which is on the Clinical Reminders Managers Menu – PXRM REMINDERS MANAGER).

#### Reminder Icon Definitions

CPRS uses two sources for the lists of reminders, one for cover sheet reminder evaluation (dependent on the New Reminders Parameter setting) and one for the “Other” section of the tree (the PXRM CPRS LOOKUP CATEGORIES parameter). The CPRS GUI combines these two lists into one tree view.

#### New Cover Sheet Reminder List

Users that are allowed access to the PXRM CPRS CONFIGURATION menu are allowed to modify the new reminder cover sheet parameters from within the CPRS GUI. This feature is available from the Edit Cover Sheet Reminder List menu option, under the Action menu of the Reminder Tree dialog. This dialog can be accessed even when the New Reminder Parameters setting is No, allowing for the setup of reminders before actually turning them on.
Reminders entered through this dialog are stored in the ORQQPX COVER SHEET REMINDERS and ORQQPX COVER SHEET REM CLASSES parameters. Since these parameters contain coded data, it is important that these parameters are not edited directly (they should only be modified through this dialog). Note that the cover sheet reminders entered through this dialog will only be active on the cover sheet if the ORQQPX NEW REMINDER PARAMS parameter is set.
![Based on a parameter, the user may get this more advanced dialog that enables the user to configure the reminders that appear on the cover sheet.](media/6dd2e8c2549df6c74b1ea04d19dc9de4.png)
The dialog consists mainly of three large list fields. The **Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)** field displays selected information on the Reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet. The **Available Reminders & Categories** field lists all available Reminders and serves as a selection list. The **Level Reminders** field displays the Reminders that you have added to or removed from the cumulative list at a specified level.
You may sort the Reminders in the **Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)** field by clicking on any of the column headers. Click on the Seq (Sequence) column header to view the Reminders in the order in which they will be displayed on the Cover Sheet.
An icon legend is displayed to the right of the **Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)** field. A folder icon represents a Reminder Category while a red alarm clock represents an individual Reminder. A Reminder with a plus sign in the first column has been added to the list while a Reminder with a minus sign in the first column has been removed from the list, if it was specified at a higher level. A Reminder with a padlock in the first column has been added to the cover sheet list, and is locked in place, so that settings at lower levels cannot remove the reminder.
***

##### Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)

The Level column of the Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List) field displays the originating authority of the Reminder, which can include System, Division, Service, Location, User Class, and User. The Seq (Sequence) column defines the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover Sheet. If there are two or more Reminders with the same sequence number, the Reminders will be listed by level (System, Division, Service, Location, User class, User).
***
##### Select Cover Sheet Parameter Level to Display / Edit

This area of the dialog allows selection of the level you want to modify. For example, if you want to set reminders at the system level, click on the System radio button. All but the system level have accompanying drop down boxes that allow selection of the Division, Service, Location, User Class or User. These settings also determine the list that is displayed in the Cover Sheet Reminders List. Note that, when not editing a specific user class, the User Class combo box will usually remain blank. This allows all user classes to be displayed for which the specified user is a member of.
##### Available Reminders & Categories

This field displays all of the Reminders and Reminder Categories available to the user. Notice that the reminder name is in parentheses after the print name. Categories are groups of related Reminders that can be added as a group. When editing a specific level of cover sheet reminders, highlight a Reminder or Category from the Available Reminders & Categories field and click the right arrow to add them to the cover sheet reminders defined at that level.
##### Level Reminders

This field displays all cover sheet Reminders defined for the current level. To add a Reminder to this list, highlight the desired Reminder in the Available Reminders & Categories field and click the right arrow button. To delete a Reminder from this list, highlight the Reminder in the Level Reminders field and click the left arrow.
You may determine the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover Sheet by changing the Reminder’s Sequence number. To change the order of User Level Reminders, highlight Reminders and click the up arrow or down arrow until the desired order is achieved.
You may remove any higher level Reminders that are not locked by adding the Reminder to the current level, and clicking the Remove button, which places a minus sign in front of the reminder. You can lock a reminder at any level (other than the User level) by pressing the Lock button.
##### Cover Sheet Reminders

Once you have the Cumulative List, as you want it, click **View Cover Sheet Reminders** to view how the reminders will be displayed on your Cover Sheet for the specified levels.
![This dialog shows which reminders will appear on the user's cover sheet including those set at the system level and those the user cannot configure.](media/abfd50b36d459e0f4feaf353b9b02af2.png)
Once you have made all of the desired changes to the Reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet, click OK.
#### Reminder Dialog Outside Location Prompts

Within portions of a reminder dialog where historical encounter information is entered, a new parameter, ORQQPX DEFAULT LOCATIONS, can be set up to define default outside locations for the PXRM OUTSIDE LOCATION prompt (PXRM OUTSIDE LOCATION is a reminder dialog prompt that is exported with the reminders package). Each free text entry in this multi-valued parameter will appear at the top of the list of locations in the drop down list. If a number is entered as the free text value, CPRS will attempt to locate an entry in the Institution file (\#4) with the same internal entry number.
For example, a parameter setting like this:
Display Sequence Value
\---------------- -----
1 663
2 Local Pharmacy
3 640
4 Outside Physician's Office
***

Will result in an outside location drop down list like this:
![Outside location drop-down list example](media/7becf528f8d9efe7617b26f349a12208.png)
Note that Seattle, WA and Palo Alto are entries in the institution file with internal entry numbers of 663 and 640, respectively.
#### Placing Reminder Dialog Generated Text

The default behavior of reminder dialogs is to insert any text generated by the reminder dialog at the bottom of the current note. When the ORQQPX REMINDER TEXT AT CURSOR parameter is set, text will be inserted at the current cursor location.
#### Configuring the Mental Health DLL Used with Reminders

In order to use the Mental Health dynamic link library (YS_MHA.dll), some set up is necessary. A clinical application coordinator (CAC) or other individual at the site must ensure the following items have been done correctly:
-   The Mental Health DLL (YS_MHA.DLL) must be placed in the \\program files\\vista\\common directory. On the workstation, this is usually located at c:\\program files\\vista\\common files\\
-   The user must be given the YSBROKER1 menu option as a secondary menu. All users can be given this menu option because if the users do not have the appropriate key, they cannot use the restricted psychological assessment tools.
-   Individuals who will administer the psychological assessments must be given the YSP key.
**Note:** The YSP key belongs to the Mental Health package and is only necessary for a few test. This key is not new, but the individual using the new Mental Health assessments must hold the key.)
***
For additional information, please see the Mental Health and Clinical Reminders manuals.
***
#### Customizing the Mental Health Assessments Pop-Up Message Text

The CPRS GUI has an informational pop-up in which sites can define text that will display to the user when the Mental Health assessment is completed. Sites define the text for the pop-up at the same time that they define the text that will go into the progress note for the result element. For more information on how to define the text for this dialog, please see the Clinical Reminders documentation.

### OR CPRS USER CLASS EXCLUDE Parameter - Utilized to Limit Additional Signers and Filter Provider Dropdowns

OR CPRS USER CLASS EXCLUDE has been created to store an Authorization Subscription Utility (ASU) User Class that will no longer appear in listboxes called by the Remote Procedure Call, ORWU NEWPERS. Sites can set this parameter to an existing ASU User Class or create a new one.
This parameter will exclude users even if they are active with CPRS GUI “core” tab access.
In the example below, OR CPRS USER CLASS EXCLUDE is set to the ASU User Class, Clinical Dietician. The result is that all users in the Clinical Dietician ASU User Class will no longer get listed in the Additional Signers user selection box in CPRS.

## Consults Tab Settings

### Criteria Used to Determine Requests Displayed in List

The parameter ORCH CONTEXT CONSULTS contains information used to limit or customize the list of consult requests displayed to the user. This parameter is used by both the CPRS GUI and List Manager versions. It can be set by SYSTEM and by USER.
The parameter’s value is a semicolon-delimited string, the pieces of which contain the following:
a;b;c,c,c;d;e;f (example: T-90;T;5,6,8;4;S;1)
a. Begin date
b. End date
c. Status (pointer to ORDER STATUS file (\#100.01); can be multiple statuses as a comma-separated list)
1.  Service (pointer to CONSULT SERVICES file (\#123.5))
1.  Group tree view by service (V), status (S) or type (T). Grouping by Type
separates consults and procedures.
1.  Order of consults in tree view. Either reverse chronological (0) or chronological
***

The user-level value for this parameter can be set using the “Custom View” menu and saving the selected options as the default.
***

### Access Determinations

The following fields in the REQUEST SERVICES file (\#123.5) determine all user access to Consults tab actions. See Consults 3.0 documentation for detailed explanations of these fields.
-   UPDATE USERS W/O NOTIFICATIONS
-   UPDATE TEAMS W/O NOTIFICATIONS
-   ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USERS
-   ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE TEAMS
-   UPDATE USER CLASSES W/O NOTIFS
-   SPECIAL UPDATES INDIVIDUAL
***

A Consults package API, **CPRS\^GMRCACTM(Consult IEN),** evaluates the user and the above fields, and returns access level information for the user for a given consult and consult service. DUZ is expected to be set to that of the user being evaluated. The integer result is returned in the first piece of an **ORFLG(Consult IEN)** array element. Possible return values, and the Consults package menu options they allow, are as follows:
1.  GMRCACTM USER REVIEW SCREEN - simple actions. This user can basically only display information about the selected consult, or add a comment.
1.  GMRCACTM SERVICE ACTION menu - all actions possible for an update user in the selected consult’s service. This user has full access to all GUI menu options for this consult, including entering results via a TIU document. The exception is the “Administrative Complete” menu option, which is reserved for category (3) below.
1.  GMRCACTM ADMIN ACTION menu - administrative user. Administrative users have access to all consult tracking options, but do not have access to the TIU result options. They are still able to complete the selected consult via the separate “Administrative Complete” tracking menu option.
1.  User has the same access as if both 2 and 3 were in effect.
***

The second "\^" piece of the **ORFLG(Consult IEN)** array element contains the text version of the user's access level, and the third piece lists the service and field from which this access level is derived. This may be the service of the currently selected consult, or a parent service in the service hierarchy. Access to these text values is currently available for debugging via the "Last Broker Call" option on the Help menu.
***

### Setting New Request Parameters

The “New Consult” and “New Procedure” buttons, as well as the “New…” menu option, (Action \| New) can be linked to a specified order dialog, quick order, or order menu, resulting in behavior identical to ordering via the Orders tab. As exported, clicking on the buttons will display the generic consults or procedures ordering dialog. By changing the value of the parameters ORWDX NEW CONSULT or ORWDX NEW PROCEDURE, this default behavior can be modified and customized by SYSTEM, LOCATION, and USER.
These parameters cannot be directly changed using the GUI, and must be modified using the Parameter Tools menu options. Any existing order dialog, quick order, or order menu can be assigned to the parameter, at any of the three levels. A common practice is to assign the same consults or procedures order menu to the buttons as is used on the Orders tab. This provides consistent functionality, and two ways to access the same lists of quick orders.
There is currently no available way to disable the buttons entirely. A common method of effectively disabling the buttons is to create an order menu consisting of only a text entry. That entry should advise the user that ordering is only available via the Orders tab. Assign that menu to the appropriate parameter, and the menu text will be displayed to the user when the button is selected.
### COMMUNITY CARE -DS or -ADMIN Consult Orders with ADMIN Key

CPRS users who hold the security key OR ADMIN RBP TO CC are able to create and release a Community Care direct schedule or administrative consult order without possessing the ORES provider security key. The consults service order will start with Community Care (case-insensitive) and contain either –DS or –ADMIN (case insensitive). The consult order will be auto-signed as "Administratively Released by Policy" and released to the service as soon as the order has been accepted. The consult order will appear on the Orders tab with status "pending".
In addition to assigning the OR ADMIN RBP TO CC key to the user, each user will need to be added as an ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USER for each applicable Community Care Admin and DS consult as required for their role. Note that applicable consult types meet both of the following criteria:
-   The Consult title contains Community Care (not case sensitive) -and- the Consult title contains -ADMIN (case sensitive).
-   The Consult title contains Community Care (not case sensitive) -and- the Consult title contains -DS (case sensitive).
**NOTE**: The OR ADMIN RPB TO CC key is not exclusive and may be assigned in conjunction with other security keys. The most likely scenarios would be users who are assigned only the OR ADMIN RPB TO CC key or the “OR ADMIN RPB TO CC” key in conjunction with the OREMAS key. Any user who is assigned the OR ADMIN RPB TO CC key will also need to be added to the ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USER group of the applicable COMMUNITY CARE -ADMIN and -DS consults. See the Admin Key Technical Training Guide for detailed setup steps. VDL\>CPRS: Consult/Request Tracking\>oc_adminkey_tech_tg.docx.
## Discharge Summary Tab Settings

### Requirements for Admission and Attending

Creating a new discharge summary differs from creating a new progress note in two main areas.
First, every discharge summary must be linked to a hospital admission. The document properties dialog that is initially displayed when creating a new summary contains a list of admissions to which the new document can be linked. In the GUI, there is currently an enforced limit of one discharge summary per admission episode. The TIU document parameters defined for the DISCHARGE SUMMARY document class allow a setting of multiple documents per admission, but the GUI does not currently use this setting.
Secondly, for discharge summaries, the patient’s attending physician is always the expected cosigner of the document, and this co-signature is required in all cases. The document properties dialog displayed on creation of a new summary contains a selection box labeled “Attending” to set this value. There is no default value for this selection box.
An attending physician must be selected from the list of active users possessing the PROVIDER key. When you click OK, the selected attending physician is checked against the USER CLASS file to determine the presence of a currently active membership in the PROVIDER user class.
***

### Criteria Used to Determine Summaries Shown in List

The parameter ORCH CONTEXT SUMMRIES contains information used to limit or customize the list of summaries displayed to the user. This parameter is used by both the CPRS GUI and List Manager versions. It can be set by SYSTEM and by USER. The parameter’s value is a semicolon-delimited string, the pieces of which contain the following:
a;b;c;d;e;f;g;h;i;j;k;l Example: **T-90;T;1;1329;20;1;A;1;1;T;B;test**
***

a Begin date
b End date
c Status (pointer to the TIU STATUS file (\#8925.6))
d Author (pointer to the NEW PERSON file (\#200))
e Occurrence Limit - The number of notes actually shown by default is determined by using the Occurrence Limit from the parameter, and then, if not present, the NUMBER OF NOTES ON REV SCREEN from TIU preferences.
f If present and non-zero, show subject in notes list.
g Sort notes in list view by visit date (D), author (A), title (T), location (L), or subject (S).
h If present and non-zero, sort tree view chronologically, otherwise reverse chronologically.
i If present and non-zero, sort list view chronologically, otherwise reverse chronologically.
j Group notes in treeview by visit date (D), author (A), title (T), or location (L).
k Field to search for keyword in (l). Subject (S), Title (T), or Both (B).
l Keyword to search for in fields defined in (k).
***

The user-level value for this parameter can be set using the “Custom View” menu and saving the selected options as the default.
## Labs Tab Settings

The Labs tab is only used for reviewing lab results. Ordering is done from the Orders tab. You cannot make configuration changes to add other reports to the Labs tab.
The reports correspond to reports in the Lab package.
Remote Data Views are also available from the Labs tab. They are discussed in the Remote Data View section.
### Labs Reports

These reports are hard-coded specifically for the GUI:
| **Report**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Graph                  | Similar to Lab’s Graph Report (1 test)                                                                                                                                      |
| Microbiology           | Routine similar to Lab’s Micro Report used on Interim                                                                                                                       |
These reports use a HOST file to display results:
| Report             | Description                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Anatomic Pathology | Lab’s AP Report                           |
| Blood Bank         | Lab’s Blood Bank Report                   |
| Lab Status         | Similar to Lab’s Order Test Status Report |
## Reports tab

The Reports tab has a collection of reports that are available to review. The following parameters are used in the Reports Tab:
ORCH CONTEXT REPORTS – This parameter is used when the imaging report is selected to determine the date range and occurrence limits of the reports to display for selection. This parameter can be set at the SYSTEM and USER levels.
*Example value:* **T-365;T;;;10**
This example value has a date range from a year ago (T-365) to today (T).
Remote Data Views are also viewable from the Reports tab (discussed later).
### Host file setup

Many of the reports use the same M code for display in the GUI and display to terminal based applications. Using a HOST file to act as a buffer to hold the report does this. The code uses the same M write commands and spacing as if writing to a printer or screen display. The data in the host file is then read into a global using %ZISH utilities provided by Kernel. The global can then be passed back to the GUI application via the RPC Broker or used for conventional reporting (e.g. List Manager). This allows report changes to affect both the GUI and screen displays.
### Quick Order Reports to Correct Dosages for Order Checks

CPRS has two quick order reports to help users check on the dosages so that they will function correctly with Medication Order Check HealthCare Application version 2 (MOCHA 2) Dosage Checks. The reports check CPRS quick orders for mixed case and free text dosages so that they can be corrected to comply with a local possible dose on the system. The reports are
-   Quick Order Mixed-Case Report (OR QO CASE REPORT)
-   Quick Order Free Text Report (OR QO FREE TEXT)
#### Quick Order Mixed-Case Report

The accuracy of local dosage setup is vitally important to a site’s success with MOCHA v2.0 Dosage Checks. Dosage and medication route reviews were first introduced with the MOCHA Pre-Implementation patch PSS\*1\*129 in 2009. Additionally, Quick Orders (QO) contain dosages which may need to be updated.
A Quick Order Mixed-Case Report is provided with the OR\*3\*366 patch and will be displayed on the Order Menu Management [ORCM MGMT] menu option. It will identify medication quick orders that are on an ordering menu and contain problematic dosages that do not match any of the Local Possible Dosages (LPD) because of case differences in the drug name. This report specifically looks at Dispense Drugs that have had a change in mixed-case (Tall Man Lettering) since the QO was created.
##### Display of Sample Report

Quick Order Mixed-Case Report [OR QO CASE REPORT]

This report identifies quick orders that have potentially had the DRUG name edited such that when the quick order is loaded in CPRS the dosage that is saved with the quick order does not match any of the dosages available for selection in the list. This causes the dosage checks not to be able to be performed correctly. The edit to the drug that this specifically looks for is a case change to the DRUG name. If the name is changed so that it contains different characters that are not just case changes, this report will not identify them.

***

##### Purpose of Report

This report is used to identify which Quick Orders will cause the following type of order check message in CPRS until it is corrected:
**Generic Message**
Maximum Single Dose Check could not be done for Drug: \<\<DRUG NAME HERE\>\>, please complete a manual check for appropriate Dosing.
***

**Example Message**

***

**Note:** If there are no results displayed when running this report then there is nothing to update and no further action is required
***

##### Example Display in CPRS

The dosage from the drop down box should have been highlighted automatically. Since it is not, this is an indication that the Quick Order is not selecting the dispense drug. This will cause the dosage to be interpreted as a free text dosage and a manual dosing check may be required.
![This screen capture shows the Outpatient Medications dialog with a drug selected, but the dosage drop-down box should have been highlighted and it is not.](media/2875dfa644d31a922293de6fe3631570.png)

###### Is this an issue for all drugs that are changed to/from Tall Man Lettering?

No, this only applies to quick orders when the name of the drug is part of the dose. This name is displayed after the “OF” conjunction (those without a metric dose unit).
###### Example of Quick Order with mixed-cased that will not show up on the report:

**Note:** This example is listed here to explain why a mixed-case dispense drug may not be displayed on the report when you may expect it to be. These will not cause a manual dose check due to mixed-case and thus no editing of the quick order is required.

#### Quick Order Free Text Report

The accuracy of local dosage setup is vitally important to a site’s success with MOCHA v2.0 Dosage Checks. Dosage and medication route reviews were first introduced with the MOCHA Pre-Implementation patch PSS\*1\*129 in 2009. Additionally, Quick Orders contain dosages that may need to be updated.
A Quick Order Free Text Report is provided in the OR\*3\*366 patch. It will identify medication quick orders that potentially contain problematic dosages that do not match any of the Possible Dosages (PD) or Local Possible Dosages (LPD) that are associated with the defined Orderable Item.
When a match cannot be determined, then the dose is considered a free text dose. Dosage checks are possible with free text doses, but if improperly formatted they are more prone to Dose Check failures than orders associated with PDs and LPDs. After initial reviews are completed, the reports may be run periodically.
The Quick Order Free Text Report is designed to be run in a variety of ways, based on the type of quick order (System Level and Personal) and the type of dosage (PD and LPD). The intent is to group similar issues together in order help users to determine if/where an edit needs to occur and to expedite the review process.
To understand and perform the review process, users must have knowledge of and access to both quick orders and pharmacy dosage setup. As quick order roles and responsibilities vary from site to site, it is anticipated that a collaborative effort between Pharmacy Informatics and Clinical Coordinators will likely be required at most sites.

##### Report Options

![This graphic shows the report hierarchy how there are three types of quick orders that the Free-Text Report checks: system quick orders, personal quick orders, and person and system quick orders. And then under each one of those categories, there are local possible dosages, possible dosages, and no local and possible dosages. ](media/b4e4e21178d434fb95fc8ae57aeed36f.png)

##### Dosage Basics for CPRS Displays

###### The CPRS dosage list and the Quick Order report share the same display rules

-   For Dosages to display the Dispense Drug must be *marked* and Dosage *assigned* to the same package as the Quick Order *type* being used.
**If:**
1.  PDs are *assigned* for Inpatient package *(250MG,500MG,1000MG)*
1.  LPDs are *assigned* for Outpatient package *(1 CAPSULE, 2 CAPSULES)*
1.  QO type is for entered for Unit Dose Medications
**Then:**
1.  The selectable dosages will be PDs (250MG,500MG,1000MG)
![This screen capture shows the selectable dosages from the report that has been run.](media/fb16bf1e7411d7fb07ae9beb5bac73c5.png)
-   If an orderable item (OI) has multiple dispense drugs, and at least one of those dispense drugs has PDs set for a specific package, then PDs will be the only type of dose that is available for any Quick Order entered for that same package.
-   If no PD is marked for the package that is being used by a QO, then any available LPDs will display as choices during both CPRS ordering and listed on the QO LPD reports.
-   Free text doses can be entered on QO’s, but PDs and/or LPDs should be used whenever possible. Free-text rules apply for dosage checks.
###### Dosage Scenarios:

**Example 1**: System Quick Orders with Possible Dosages in the CPRS Dosage list
*Local Possible Dosages may also be present and assigned to the Orderable Item and assigned to both packages, but may not be viewable in the CPRS Dosage List because of the display rules for CPRS dosages.*

The following Quick Orders are all using the Orderable Item: ACETAMINOPHEN TAB which has a single active dispense drug ‘ACETAMINOPHEN 500MG TAB’ *assigned* to the respective package. For each display group (Outpatient Medications and Unit Dose Medications) there is either a ‘FREE TEXT’ dosage or a selected LPD.
1 PSUZ APAP IP FREE TEXT
2 PSUZ APAP IP LPD USED
3 PSOZ APAP OP FREE TEXT
4 PSOZ APAP OP LPD USED
***

Since none of the free text dosages in the QO INSTRUCTIONS match any of the Possible Dosages in the CPRS Dosage List, this report prints all four Quick Orders. Possible Dosages are available for both packages, so any Local Possible Dosages will not be seen.
If available, additional Possible Dosages from other Dispense Drugs(s) tied to the same Orderable Item (*such as ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB*) would be displayed in the CPRS Dosage List. In this example, ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB has Possible Dosages, but is inactive; therefore, none of the Possible Dosages (325MG or 650MG) are showing.

#### Quick Order Report FAQs

**Q: Does this report filter out Personal Quick Orders for Terminated Employees?**
**A:** The code examines all of the owners of a personal quick order. If all of the owners are inactive (either DISUSERED, TERMINATED, or do not have an access code), the personal quick order will not be listed on the report.
***

**Q: Does this report Exclude QO’s not used within specific time frame?**
**A:** This is not possible because we do not track usage of quick orders. However, a Fileman Report could be created to find these.
***

**Q: Does this report screen out QO’s that are not on any active menu?**
**A:** The code excludes quick orders that are either not on a menu, not a personal quick order, or not part of a reminder dialog.
***

**Q: How does the dispense drug get chosen? I am seeing several examples of some funny entries with wrong dispense drugs:**
QUICK ORDER (IEN): ORWDQ EC331281 (6123)
QO DISPLAY NAME: etodolac
OWNER(S): PROVIDER, A
DISPLAY GROUP: OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS
ORDERABLE ITEM IEN: 4155
ORDERABLE ITEM NAME: eTODoLAC CAP,ORAL
QO INSTRUCTIONS: **400MG**
DISPENSE: ETODOLAC 300MG CAP **Why ETODOLAC 300MG?**
CPRS DOSAGE LIST:
200MG
300MG
***

**A:** CPRS builds a list of dispense drugs associated with an orderable item. In this case the OI comes from the quick order so we build the list of dispense drugs and since this is a free text entry we can’t determine what the dispense drug is yet on the CPRS side. So any dispense drugs under that OI show on this report but do not necessarily reflect the dispense drug sent to pharmacy, it is a best guess.

#### Free Text Formatting

##### Basic logic for successful dose checks when using free text doses

*The following logic can be used to ensure free text dose entries perform dose checks, but may not prevent quick orders from appearing on this report.*
**Compatible Free Text Logic - will generate a successful dosing check**
-   Whole numbers (2, two) followed by a valid dose unit (mg, tablet)
-   Numbers with decimal points and commas (10.5, 1,000)
-   Sequential Ranges (2-3, 2 – 3, 2 or 3, two to three, two or three, two-three, two – three)
-   Fractions (1 and ½, one and one half, one and one-half, 1 and one half, 1 and one-half)
***

**Incompatible Free Text Logic - will generate a manual dose check alert**
-   More than one space between the numeric value and the dose unit
-   Trailing spaces or additional trailing data (10mg\<space\>)
-   Special characters (- &/) and extraneous textual information
-   Fractions less than ¼ or greater than 10 and ½
-   Ranges greater than 10 (10-11)
-   Non-sequential ranges (1-3, 2-5)
-   Metric ranges (1mg-2mg, 1mL-2mL)
***

**Examples:**
| **Valid Format** | **Invalid Format**                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 10mg             | 10mg\<space\>                                 |
| 10 mg            | 10 mg (has 2 spaces between text)             |
| 10mL             | 1 tablet (*has 2 spaces*)                     |
| 1 tablet         | 10mg (1 tablet) or 10mg (10mL) or 10mg/10mL\* |
| 1tablet          |                                               |
\*This format will only work if a Local Possible Dosage is created. Name the Local Possible Dosage with the full text, but define the numeric dose (10) and dose unit (mg)
***

#### Quick Order Free Text Report Checklist

-   Review your hospital’s quick order policies prior to editing System Quick Orders.
-   Determine an action plan for editing Personal Quick Orders, whether the edit will be performed directly by the provider or alternatively via the Edit Personal Quick Orders by User option
-   Run each of the following report combinations:
-   Personal Quick Orders
-   Local Possible Dosages
-   Possible Dosages
-   No Local Possible and No Possible Dosages
***

-   System Quick Orders
-   Local Possible Dosages
-   Possible Dosages
-   No Local Possible and No Possible Dosages
***

-   For each Quick Order that displays on the report, look into Orderable Item and Drug File to determine what packages the Dispense Drug(s) and available dosages are marked/assigned to.
-   Review available/applicable Possible Dosages and Local Possible Dosages
-   Assign the most appropriate dosage to the Quick Order.
-   In some cases an existing Possible Dosage or Local Possible Dosage can be selected
-   In some cases the existing Local Possible Dosage may need to be edited to a format that is compatible with MOCHA Dosage Checks, and then the Quick Order dosage can also be updated
-   In some cases a new Possible Dosage or Local Possible Dosage may need to be added to the Drug File \#50
-   In some cases, the most appropriate dosage will be the one that already exists on that Quick Order, and no change is needed
-   In some cases a new free text dose will need to be entered. Ensure that a compatible free text format is used whenever possible
-   If a drug file edit is required, then other Quick Orders associated with that dispense drug or orderable item may also be affected by the edit. You may consider running a Fileman to identify the other Quick Orders using the drug.
**NOTE**: Not all Quick Orders listed on the report represent MOCHA Dose Check issues; they simply reveal mismatches between doses in quick orders and locally available possible and/or local possible dosages, which is a common cause for manual dose checks alerts.

### Health Summary Configuration

ORWRP HEALTH SUMMARY LIST ALL – Used on the Health Summary report to present all health summary types for selection. This parameter can be set by SYSTEM, DIVISION or USER.
ORWRP HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE LIST – Used on the Health Summary report to determine the sequence and allowable health summary types for selection. This parameter can be set by SYSTEM and USER.
***

### Daily Order Summary

The term Daily refers to a user specified date on which orders were entered. Any orders entered on the specified date will appear on the Daily Order Summary.
### Improving Graphing Performance: Graphing Resource Device

**Note:** In CPRS v.29, caching for graphing is disabled.
CPRS v27 has improved performance on graphing patient data by using a “cache” that gathers and temporarily stores the patient’s data in advance of using graphing functions.
Using the cache avoids always fetching the data. When caching is not used, the graphing functions extract data when items are selected, which can be time-consuming.
Caching is only used under specific conditions and is transparent to the user. Caching happens only when a user has previously graphed results on a specific patient. When Provider A is reviewing Patient Z for the first time, graphing will extract data only when items are selected. If Provider A selects Patient Z again and uses graphing, the following sequence happens:
1.  A job is started in the background, this job checks to see if the patient already has cached data.
-   If the patient has cached data, then only recent data is extracted to update that cache.
-   If there is no cached data, then all data on the patient is extracted to create a new cache. This ensures that the cache has all data on the patient.
***

1.  The cache is transferred to the CPRS application for use with graphing.
1.  While the user is graphing patient data, the application continuously checks if the cache has been transferred (if there is new data), and if it has it uses that new data. Otherwise, continues using the old method of extracting from selected items.
In order to make sure that there is not excessive system processing of extracting data, a new resource device (ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE) is included in CPRS v27. It is initially set to only allow 3 processes to be running at one time. The Resource Slots field can be changed to allow more or less processes to occur.

## Printing

### Assigning a Default CPRS Printer

You can designate which printer should be the default printer for a CPRS user and for the printing of orders, such as chart copy, work copy, and labels. You should know three things about printing in CPRS:
1.  Graphs and popup windows of detailed displays can ONLY be printed to a Windows printer.
1.  Printing of orders is affected by a different set of parameters than the default printer for other items that can be printed from the chart.
1.  When a user selects a printer during a print operation, that printer remains the default for the session unless the user selects a different printer or logs out and logs back in, which will change back to the saved defaults. They can also click the checkbox on the dialog to make the selected printer their default.
***

The two parameters that affect printer selection:
-   ORWDP DEFAULT PRINTER
-   ORWDP WINPRINT DEFAULT
***

### Setting a Default Printer

The parameter ORWDP DEFAULT PRINTER allows a default printer to be set at the LOCATION and USER levels. Setting this parameter to an entry in the DEVICE file will cause that device to be selected as the default in all VistA printer selection dialogs. The one exception is the Orders Print dialog. Because other parameters related to printing orders come into play in that case, the default printer defined here does not apply to printing orders. Those parameters are described in more detail below.
The session default printer, i.e., the most recently used printer, takes precedence over the value set in this parameter.
The check box on the printer dialog allows the individual user to set this parameter at the USER level without the need to use the roll-and-scroll parameter tools options.
***

### Setting a Windows Printer as a User’s Default Printer

You can designate a local, Windows, or network printer as the default. The parameter ORWDP WINPRINT DEFAULT can be set at the SYSTEM, LOCATION, and USER LEVEL.
If this parameter is set to TRUE, the default Windows printer for each workstation will be used as the default printer for all printing tasks except orders. When a user clicks on **File \| Print**, CPRS displays the standard Windows print dialog instead of the VistA printer selection dialog, and any output will be sent to the selected Windows printer.
Also, if “Windows Printer” is selected on the VistA printer selection dialog, and the “Save as User Default” checkbox is checked, this parameter will be set to TRUE for the user.
**Note:** As described above, selecting a Windows printer, regardless of whether it is the default, will result in that printer becoming the default printer for the session or until another printer is selected. When a user select a Windows printer, the VistA printer selection dialog no longer appears. A VistA printer cannot be selected. To select a VistA printer, the user must click on **File \| Print Setup** and choose the desired VistA printer.
***

Graphs and popup windows of detailed displays can ONLY be printed to a Windows printer. For these items, the Windows print dialog will appear regardless of any default printer settings.
***

### Setting Up Orders Printing

The Print/Report Parameters option sets up the printing of orders and is accomplished via the OR PARAM PRINTS parameter on the Clinical Coordinators menu. There should be no need to edit the parameters directly. The parameters affected are as follows:
-   ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE
-   ORPF PROMPT FOR CHART COPY
-   ORPF PROMPT FOR WORK COPY
-   ORPF WORK COPY PRINT DEVICE
-   ORPF PROMPT FOR REQUISITIONS
-   ORPF REQUISITION PRINT DEVICE
-   ORPF PROMPT FOR LABELS
-   ORPF LABEL PRINT DEVICE
-   ORCL NATURE
**NOTE:** If Room-Bed “device” configurations are needed, the parameters must be edited directly through the CPRS Manager Menu / CPRS Configuration (IRM) / General Parameter Tools menu. Room-Bed fields are not available under the Print/Report Parameters menu. Also, the corresponding locations for the Room-Bed settings must be defined in the “prompt” parameters since “prompts” can’t be set at the Room-Bed level.
***
#### ORPF Prompt for Chart Copy and ORPF Prompt for Work Copy

ORPF Prompt For CHART Copy and ORPF Prompt For WORK Copy parameters affect the checkbox and the “Change” button for each copy type.
##### Possible Values:

1.  PROMPT AND ASK DEVICE
-   Checkbox will be unchecked and enabled.
-   “Change” button will be enabled.
***

1.  PROMPT BUT DON’T ASK DEVICE
-   Checkbox will be unchecked and enabled.
-   “Change” button will be disabled.
***

1.  DON’T PROMPT
-   Checkbox will be checked and disabled.
-   “Change” button will be disabled.
-   Print type will be highlighted in reverse video.
***

1.  DON’T PRINT
-   Checkbox will be unchecked and disabled.
-   “Change” button will be disabled.
***

If none of the copy types are set up to require any prompting, the print dialog will not be displayed, and the appropriate copies will simply be printed or not, depending on the values of the respective parameters.
Highlighted items will always print, regardless of the method used to exit the print dialog. They have been defined to print in all cases without prompting.
Print formats are defined in the OE/RR PRINT FORMATS file (\#100.23). The parameters ORPF CHART COPY FORMAT and ORPF WORK COPY FORMAT determine which of the pre-defined formats will apply to a given copy type, for both the GUI and CPRS List Manager. If no print format is defined for the specific type of copy, the checkbox and the change button will be disabled in the GUI, and no device will be selected.
#### ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE and ORPF WORK COPY PRINT DEVICE

The ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE and ORPF WORK COPY PRINT DEVICE Parameters determine which, if any, device appears in the device selection box as the default.
#### ORCL NATURE

For each Nature of Order, CPRS can be configured through the Print Parameters for Nature of Order menu item to print a chart copy, print on the daily summary, or print a work copy and whether or not the specified nature of order should show under Active orders on the Orders tab. If the Nature of Order is configured to print, then the other parameters in the list above are checked to determine if CPRS should present the user with the dialog asking whether the user wants to print the copy or to which device the copy should be sent.
**Note:** Previously, these options for each Nature of Order could be set using Fileman, but Fileman access to these options will no longer be allowed. The menu item Print Parameters for Nature of Order is the only way to set these options.
***

The following four fields in the NATURE OF ORDER file (\#100.02) can be edited through this option:
-   PRINT CHART COPY (\#.12)
-   PRINT DAILY SUMMARY (\#.13)
-   PRINT WORK COPY (\#.15)
-   INCLUDE IN ACTIVE ORDERS (\#.16)
***

Below is a sample execution of the new option:
Select Print/Report Parameters Option: NA Print Parameters for Nature of Order
***

Select NATURE OF ORDER: AUTO A
PRINT CHART COPY: NO//
PRINT DAILY SUMMARY: NO//
PRINT WORK COPY: NO//
INCLUDE IN ACTIVE ORDERS: NO//
***

Select NATURE OF ORDER:

## Appendix A - RPCs

Remote procedure calls (RPCs) have the OR namespace in the Remote Procedure file. This listing shows the RPCs listed alphabetically with the tag and M routine. The GUI will call these M procedures using the RPC Broker.
These calls are not public utilities and may be subject to change in the future. A FileMan inquiry on the RPC entry in the Remote Procedure file will display other information.
All of these RPCs must be included in the OR CPRS GUI CHART option for users to use the GUI.

## Appendix C - Parameters by Function

Parameters provide many ways of setting defaults for an application. Parameters are defined in the Parameter Definition file (8989.51). The Parameters file (8989.5) contains the specific defaults. They are exported and installed in an application using the KIDS build. A parameter definition has associated with it one or more entities. An entity may be a user, location, system, package, or other category. Associated with a particular entity is a value. The different entities have precedence as to what default may apply in a particular circumstance. For example, a date range default for a report in the package CPRS is set at T-30 days. The user, CPRSPROVIDER,TEN, has a default for this report of 6 months, T-180 days. If the parameter is defined with a precedence of [User, Package], the user will be prompted with the T-180 default. Because of the precedence, the User default takes exception over the Package default. The parameter files allow for tremendous flexibility in arranging defaults. Parameters are a Kernel utility; more technical information is covered in the Kernel Toolkit documentation.
If a user does not have DUZ(0)= “@” then they will not see package level settings for parameters. Generally, it is recommended that the package level settings are not changed.
### Menus for modifying Parameters

CPRS users can access editing parameters from the following options.
| Personal Preference             | ORPO MENU                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) | OR PARAM COORDINATOR MENU |
| CPRS Configuration (IRM)        | OR PARAM IRM MENU         |
| General Parameter Tools         | XPAR MENU TOOLS           |
CPRS parameters are in the OR\* namespace. They are listed in this documentation by functional categories and alphabetically. The alphabetical listing is a captioned printout of the OR namespaced entries in the Parameters file (8989.5).

##### Manual Release Control Setting

This parameter defines how access to the manual release action is controlled. There are three possible settings:

1.  Manual Release Parameter Only - In this setting the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter controls who is allowed to manually release a delayed order. The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter is distributed with no settings, which effectively denies access to manual release if the control parameter is set to P. In order to have the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter control access to the manual release action you must set some level of the parameter to a positive (YES) value.
1.  Both Keys and Parameter - In this setting a check is first made to see if the user has either the ORES or ORELSE key. If they do not then a check is made to see if the user will have access through the parameter settings. In this setting, if the user does not hold either the ORES or ORELSE key they could still have access to the action based on your parameter settings, which may be more liberal than you'd like.

At sites implementing auto-renewal, the auto-renewal process uses this value to populate the 'entered by' value in the ORDERS (\#100) file. Because every renewal order will have the same proxy user in the “entered by” value, providers can easily identify that a prescription renewal was processed from AudioRENEWAL. Normally, this parameter is only set once.

##### Msg To Display On Inpt Ord Of Clozapine

This parameter allows sites to set what text they would like for users to see when an inpatient order of Clozapine is made. This drug is generally ordered in an outpatient setting and thus is subject to the special order appropriateness checks. However, when ordered in an inpatient setting these checks are not done. Thus sites should determine a policy to handle this and provide instructions to users based on that policy.
**Note:** The above text is what is found in the parameter description. A clarification to this text will be included in the next build of CPRS. The description should read as follows:
***

Clozapine is usually prescribed in an outpatient setting, but it can be ordered for inpatients. However, the special appropriateness order checks that occur when finishing in the backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy setting do not occur in the finishing process in backdoor Inpatient Pharmacy. In addition, backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy sends the clozapine information to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) database. Some sites have directed the ordering provider to place a corresponding outpatient order when placing an inpatient clozapine order. The sites that have this policy can use the new OR CLOZ INPT MSG parameter to help reinforce this policy to the ordering providers.

VALUE DATA TYPE: pointer
VALUE DOMAIN: 200
**Note:** This parameter is only for sites using auto-renewal with an automated telephone renewal system. Each site enters a value that points to a proxy user that the site has created. At sites implementing auto-renewal, the auto-renewal process uses this value to populate the 'entered by' value in the ORDERS (\#100) file. Because every renewal order will have the same proxy user in the “entered by” value, providers can easily identify that a prescription renewal was processed from AudioRENEWAL. Normally, this parameter is only set once.
***

DESCRIPTION: This parameter points to a proxy user in the NEW PERSON (\#200) file created for the auto-renewal process.

VALUE HELP: Enter a message to display when an Inpat. Order of Clozapine is made
INSTANCE DATA TYPE: free text
DESCRIPTION: This parameter allows sites to set what text they would like for users to see when an inpatient order of Clozapine is made. This drug is generally ordered in an outpatient setting and thus is subject to the special order appropriateness checks. However, when ordered in an inpatient setting these checks are not done. Thus, sites should determine a policy to handle this and provide instructions to users based on that policy.
**Note:** The above text is what is found in the parameter description. A clarification to this text will be included in the next build of CPRS. The parameter description should read as follows:
***

Clozapine is usually prescribed in an outpatient setting, but it can be ordered for inpatients. However, the special appropriateness order checks that occur when finishing in the backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy setting do not occur in the finishing process in backdoor Inpatient Pharmacy. In addition, backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy sends the clozapine information to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) database. Some sites have directed the ordering provider to place a corresponding outpatient order when placing an inpatient clozapine order. The sites that have this policy can use the new OR CLOZ INPT MSG parameter to help reinforce this policy to the ordering providers.

Enter the alert identifier (or a portion of the alert identifier) for each type of alert you want to be able to remove in the CPRS GUI via the Remove button. The alert identifier or XQAID can be found in the ALERT ID field of the ALERT file [\#8992]. For this parameter use the first few characters of the ALERT ID. For example, to remove NOIS alerts enter FSC. You may enter as many alert identifiers as desired. Please note that most alert IDs include information specific to the patient or instance which triggered the alert. For this parameter you should only enter that portion of the alert ID which is consistent for all alerts of this type. For example, a NOIS alert's ID might actually look like FSC-M,275546. Entering the entire alert ID in this parameter will only allow removal of this specific alert. However if the parameter value is FSC, all NOIS alerts can be removed.
Other examples of non-OR alert IDs include:
NO-ID;17;3040628.131502 [Taskman alert] - use NO-ID in parameter
TIUERR,3423,1;1450;3040518.125801 [TIU error alert] - use TIUERR

VALUE DOMAIN: K:Keys Only (ORES/ORELSE);P:Manual Release Parameter Only (OREVE NT MANUAL RELEASE);B:Both (K and P)
VALUE HELP: Select how the use of the manual release action should be controlled.
DESCRIPTION: This parameter defines how access to the manual release action is controlled. There are three possible settings:
1: Keys Only - In this setting only holders of the ORES and ORELSE key may manually release a delayed order. This is how the system previously controlled access to this action. If the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameter is not set then this will be the default setting.
2: Manual Release Parameter Only - In this setting the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter controls who is allowed to manually release a delayed order. The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter is distributed with no settings, which effectively denies access to manual release if the control parameter is set to P. In order to have the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter control access to the manual release action you must set some level of the parameter to a positive (YES) value.
3: Both Keys and Parameter - In this setting a check is first made to see if the user has either the ORES or ORELSE key. If they do not then a check is made to see if the user will have access through the parameter settings. In this setting, if the user does not hold either the ORES or ORELSE key they could still have access to the action based on your parameter settings, which may be more liberal than you'd like. Be sure to check your settings.

DISPLAY TEXT: JLV Remote Button Label Name
VALUE TERM: JLV REMOTE BUTTON LABEL NAME
VALUE DATA TYPE: free text
VALUE HELP: Enter the name for the JLV/VistaWeb Remote button
DESCRIPTION:
This parameter works with the ORWRP VISTAWEB ADDRESS parameter for viewing external remote data using the WEB. VistaWeb has been the vehicle for viewing external remote data, but the VA is transitioning to a new vehicle called JLV (Joint Legacy Viewer). When a site moves to JLV, this parameter value will need to be set to "JLV" and the URL will need to be updated to point to the JLV website.

## Appendix E - Creating CPRS Extension COM Object in Delphi

Due to technical problems with out-of-process CPRS extensions, it is recommended that in-process servers be created. This document offers step-by-step instructions to creating an in-process COM server that extends CPRS functionality, following by specifications on the CPRS Type Library interfaces. Instructions were made using Delphi 5. Other versions of Delphi may or may not be compatible with these instructions, but it should be possible to create CPRS extensions in any version of Delphi that supports COM object creation, as well as other programming languages that support the creation of COM objects.
1.  Start Delphi.
1.  Select the File \| New menu
1.  Select the ActiveX tab, and ActiveX Library, and click on OK.
![The New Items dialog in Delphi showing the ActiveX tab.](media/8d9069403a1ff484ff42d95c4c2d50da.png)
1.  Save your project - give it a meaningful name (don't close the project, just save it). This example uses the project name SampleCPRSExtension.
1.  Select Project \| Import Type Library. This dialog will display:
![The Import Type Library dialog](media/3beae30e9bb17d6433e7ce209909db68.png)
1.  Click the Add button. This will pull up a standard open file dialog - select the CPRSChart.exe file (which may reside in a different directory) and click on the Open button.
1.  CPRSChart Library should now be selected in the Import Type Library window. Click the Create Unit button. A new unit, CPRSChart_TLB.pas will be created and displayed in the Delphi code editor.
1.  Select the File \| New menu again.
1.  Select the ActiveX tab, Automation Object, and click OK.
1.  You will be presented with this dialog. Leave all the defaults, and provide a meaningful CoClass Name and click OK. This example uses the SampleCOMObject class name.
![The Automation Object Wizard dialog](media/9bf22edb4d7392e887c0a795d43dd620.png)
1.  The type library editor will automatically appear. With the ActiveX library name still selected in the tree view, click on the Uses tab.
![A dialog showing the SampleCPRSExtension.tlb selected](media/c03689c4a2111f169467400ef502be58.png)
1.  The uses tab will show two entries - Borland standard VCL type library, and OLE Automation. Uncheck the Borland standard VCL type library check box. This will produce the following message:
![This warning message telling you that removing the type library will undefine listed items.](media/10424a2911ad63ceb8866353ad3685e0.png)

1.  Click on Yes. Developers who wish to use interfaces defined in Borland standard VCL type library may do so, but will be required to distribute and register Borland's stdvcl40.dll file with their application.
1.  Right click on the Uses tab, and select the Show All Type Libraries menu option.
1.  ![The dialog showing type libraries and the right click-menu showing the item Show All Type Libraries.](media/cb81681e6368bf341c601a1ad78b36a9.png)
    The Uses tab should now display numerous entries. Scroll down the list until you see CPRSChart Library. Click on the check box to the left of this entry to include the CPRSChart library.
![The SampleCPRSExtension.tlb dialog showing the CPRSChart Library checked.](media/27fcc4d2749a0d7e612463282093ea60.png)
1.  In the tree view on the left, click on the CoClass entry. This will have a ![](media/4196c67b3aae48e7a4173c6c0469b1fe.png) symbol next to it, and will probably be the last entry in the tree view.
1.  Click on the Implements tab.
1.  Right click on the Implements tab, and select the Insert Interface menu option.
![Working on the Implements tab with SampleCPRSExtenion.tlb. The right-click menu item Insert Interface is shown.](media/24a64c3c71805c92968743853aa6f9f3.png)

1.  A dialog will appear with several entries in it. Select the ICPRSExtension entry, and click OK.
![The Insert Interface dialog is shown with ICPRSEntension highlighted.](media/2f624141ea09cbfbb025e313d130666c.png)
1.  The Implements tab should now contain the ICPRSExtension entry.
![When the user has selected ICRPSExtension, it will be displayed on the Implements tab.](media/3f6b0d2104072623e8f0ce516d87fb25.png)
1.  Save the project again. You will be asked to save a new unit. Give this unit a meaningful name, preferably the same CoClass name entered in step \#10. This example uses the SampleCOMObject.pas unit name.
1.  Select the unit just saved in the Delphi code editor (e.g. SampleCOMObject). In the top uses section, add CPRSChart_TLB to the uses clause (you must make this change before you will be able to compile). The unit should now look something like this:
unit SampleCOMObject;
***

ComObj, ActiveX, SampleCPRSExtension_TLB, StdVcl, CPRSChart_TLB;
***

type
TSampleCOMObject = class(TAutoObject, ISampleCOMObject, ICPRSExtension)

begin
***

end;
***

initialization
TAutoObjectFactory.Create(ComServer, TSampleCOMObject, Class_SampleCOMObject,
ciMultiInstance, tmApartment);
end.
***

1.  The Execute method will be called from within CPRS when a specific event is activated. The CPRSBroker and CPRSState parameters are passed into the call, and can be used from within this event to make RPC calls and review current user and patient information. Details on these interfaces are documented below. There are currently three events within CPRS that will cause a COM object to be activated:
-   Patient Selection.
-   Order Acceptance.
-   Template activation (when the template is tied to a COM object).
***

This example will create a simple Patient Selection COM Object that displays a message with patient information. Actual use will vary but might include some kind of dialog being presented to the user, and some kind of user interaction taking place. To make this change, add the Dialogs unit to the uses clause, and add the ShowMessage code as shown:

implementation
***

uses ComServ, Dialogs;
***

function TSampleCOMObject.Execute(const CPRSBroker: ICPRSBroker;
const CPRSState: ICPRSState; const Param1, Param2, Param3: WideString;
var Data1, Data2: WideString): WordBool;
begin
ShowMessage('Patient Selected: ' + CPRSState.PatientName);
end;
***

1.  Save and compile. You will not be able to run the application since it's a DLL.
1.  Select the RUN \| Register ActiveX Server menu option. You should receive a confirmation message indicating successful registration.
1.  Open a terminal emulator program (e.g. KEA). Connect to the account where CPRS GUI v16 has been installed.
1.  Run FileMan.
1.  Select the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES option
1.  Select the OE/RR COM OBJECTS file (\#101.15) for editing
1.  You will be asked to "Select OE/RR COM OBJECTS NAME:" - enter a unique, meaningful name in uppercase.
1.  You will then be asked to enter an Object GUID. To find this value, go back to Delphi, and select the type library unit created for the project (the example file is SampleCPRSExtension_TLB.
1.  Near the top of this unit are three GUIDs defined. Select the CLASS GUID. The example would use the CLASS_SampleCOMObject GUID.
const
// TypeLibrary Major and minor versions
SampleCPRSExtensionMajorVersion = 1;
SampleCPRSExtensionMinorVersion = 0;
***

LIBID_SampleCPRSExtension: TGUID = '{D817B0F8-6F2F-11D5-82E8-00C04F72C274}';
***

IID_ISampleCOMObject: TGUID = '{D817B0F9-6F2F-11D5-82E8-00C04F72C274}';
CLASS_SampleCOMObject: TGUID = '{D817B0FB-6F2F-11D5-82E8-00C04F72C274}';
***

1.  Highlight this value, starting with the open braces '{' and ending with the close braces '}', (don't include the quotes) and copy to the clipboard.
1.  Go back to the terminal session, and paste the GUID into the Object GUI field.
1.  Leave the inactive field empty.
1.  The Param1 field will be passed directly to the COM object as Param1 in the execute method.
1.  An optional description field can be entered if desired.
1.  Exit FileMan
1.  Now we need to link the COM object to the patient selection event. Run the XPAR EDIT PARAMETER option
1.  Select the ORWCOM PATIENT SELECTED parameter
1.  Select the desired entity (for testing just use the User entity, and select yourself). You will then be asked to select an entry in the OE/RR COM OBJECTS file. Select the entry just made in steps 25-37.
1.  Run CPRS GIU v16. When selecting a patient, the ShowMessage dialog entered in step 22 should appear.
1.  To link a COM object to order acceptance, by display group, use the ORWCOM ORDER ACCEPTED parameter.
1.  To link a COM object to a template, enter the template editor in the CPRS GUI, and edit shared templates (end users are not allowed to link templates to COM objects, since this requires installation of the COM object on the workstation).
1.  Create a new Shared Template, give the template a name, and select a Template Type of COM Object. The bottom of the template editor will change to display two fields, COM Object and Passed Value. COM Object allows selection of an active entry in the OE/RR COM OBJECTS file. The passed value field is text that will be passed in Param3 of the execute method. When using the template, the COM object will be activated.

### CPRS GUI v21 Changes to COM Object Template Functionality

In the original document entitled "Creating CPRS Extension COM Object in Delphi", the Data2 parameter is described as follows with respect to templates:
"Data2 is reserved for future use, but is anticipated to be XML formatted data passed between CPRS and invoked COM objects."
The following block of XML is now transmitted to the COM object template in the Data2 parameter, as a TStrings.Text value, meaning that multiple lines are separated by carriage return line feed pairs.. The DOC_IEN entity contains the pointer to the TIU DOCUMENT file (\#8925) for the current document. The AUTHOR_IEN entity contains the pointer to the NEW PERSON file (\#200) for the currently recorded author of the document. The AUTHOR_NAME entity contains that author's name as contained in the .01 field of the NEW PERSON file (\#200). This XML is passed to the COM object on all of the TIU-related tabs in CPRS (Notes, Consults, Discharge Summary, Surgery).
\<TIU_DOC\>
\<DOC_IEN\>**ien**\</DOC_IEN\>
\<AUTHOR_IEN\>**ien**\</AUTHOR_IEN\>
\<AUTHOR_NAME\>**name**\</AUTHOR_NAME\>
\</TIU_DOC\>
***

On return from the COM object, CPRS will continue to accept modified text for the note in the DATA1 parameter. The DATA2 parameter will now also be scanned for any change in author returned by the COM object. The data returned in DATA2 must be in the following XML format to be correctly processed by CPRS. The AUTHOR_IEN entity MUST contain the pointer to the NEW PERSON file (\#200) for the newly selected author of the document. The AUTHOR_NAME entity contains that author's name as listed in the .01 field in file \#200. Returning the AUTHOR_NAME entity is optional, and it is used only for display of a message to the user in the event that the returned author is determined to be invalid.
\<TIU_DOC\>
\<DOC_IEN\>**ien**\</DOC_IEN\>
\<AUTHOR_IEN\>**ien**\</AUTHOR_IEN\>
\<AUTHOR_NAME\>**name**\</AUTHOR_NAME\>
\</TIU_DOC\>
***

Prior to acceptance and storage, the author returned by the COM object is first validated as a current entry in file 200. Next, that author is evaluated for cosignature requirements. If a cosigner is required, the user is presented with the Note Properties screen, and is required to supply a cosigner for the document. Once these requirements have been addressed, the new author (and cosigner, if applicable) is attached to the note, the COM object's text is inserted, and processing continues as before.
At this time, only the CPRS Notes tab will recognize and process a change of author. The other TIU tabs (Consults, Discharge Summary, Surgery) have additional complicating factors related to authorship which have not been addressed in this release.
### Distribution

In addition to the steps outlined above, COM objects need to be distributed and registered on each workstation where the COM object is to be used. To distribute the COM object, it needs to be copied to each machine. To register a COM object, execute the following command on each machine, after the file has been copied to the hard disk:
regsvr32 [FileName]
***

The regsvr32 program is a windows utility that registers and un-registers COM objects. [FileName] is the file path and name of the COM object being registered. For a list of additional flags that can be passed, run regsvr32 without a filename.
Note that if the COM object is not present or has not been registered, CPRS will raise an error, alerting the user that the COM Object is not registered on the workstation. Following the error, CPRS will continue on as if the COM object did not exist. Additional attempts to run the COM object will be automatically aborted without an error, until CPRS is restarted.
***

### CPRS Registration

In addition to the COM object being registered with Windows, CPRS must also be registered with Windows. Normally CPRS will automatically register itself when it is run. CPRS can optionally be registered as a COM server. An in-depth discussion of COM is beyond the scope of this document. However, by registering CPRS in this manner, client applications can use the RPC Broker in CPRS to communicate with VistA. Due to operating system security restrictions built into Windows 7 and Windows 10, administrative access is required to a computer before the CPRS COM server can be registered. This can be run from either a command prompt using administrator privileges or this can be ran via an administrator run CPRS shortcut:
CPRSChart /register
***

This registration step only needs to be performed once per workstation. If desired, this can be combined with the registration steps taken during the installation of COM objects. If, for any reason, CPRSChart needs to be unregistered, it will accept the /unregister parameter. When the /register or /unregister parameters are passed, CPRSChart will register or unregister itself silently, without any visual indication of execution.
## Appendix F - Interface Specifications

### BrokerParamType Enumeration

The BrokerParamType enumeration is the equivalent of the TParamType enumeration used by the Broker. Valid values are bptLiteral, bptReference, bptList, and bptUndefined.
### ICPRSBroker Interface

The ICPRSBroker interface provides access to the CPRS broker which allows the COM object to make remote procedures without needing to create another partition on the server.
#### SetContext function

Format: function SetContext(const Context: WideString): WordBool;
This function allows the COM object to change broker context. The return boolean result will be true if the context change was allowed.
#### Server function

Format: function Server: WideString;
This function returns the broker's server connection.
#### Port function

Format: function Port: Integer;
This function returns the current port number that is being used by the broker.
#### DebugMode function

Format: function DebugMode: WordBool;
This boolean function returns true if the broker is in debug mode.
#### CallRPC procedure

Format: procedure CallRPC(const RPCName: WideString);
This procedure sets the remote procedure name of the broker and executes the broker call method.
#### RPCVersion property

Format: property RPCVersion: WideString;
This property and its corresponding Get_RPCVersion and Set_RPCVersion methods are used to set the Broker's RPCVersion property.
#### ClearParameters property

Format: property ClearParameters: WordBool;
This property and its corresponding Get_ClearParameters and Set_ClearParameters methods are used to set the Broker's ClearParameters property.
#### ClearResults property

Format: property ClearResults: WordBool;
This property and its corresponding Get_ClearResults and Set_ClearResults methods are used to set the Broker's ClearResults property.
#### Results property

Format: property Results: WideString;
This property and its corresponding Get_Results and Set_Results methods are used to access the Broker's Result property. Since the TRPCBroker class implements this property as a TStrings object, the ICPRSBroker.Results property is the equivalent of the RPCBroker.Results.Text property. It is recommended that an internal TStrings descendant class be used to decipher multi-line Results values.
#### Accessing the RPC Broker's Params property

Three properties and two functions have been provided to access the TRPCBroker Params property.
Format: property Param[Index: Integer]: WideString;
property ParamType[Index: Integer]: BrokerParamType;
property ParamList[Index: Integer; const Node: WideString]: WideString;
function ParamCount: Integer;
function ParamListCount(Index: Integer): Integer;
***

Param[Index] is equivalent to RPCBroker.Param[Index].Value.
***

ParamType[Index] is equivalent to RPCBroker.Param[Index].PType, and accepts the BrokerParamType enumerated values detailed above.
***

ParamList[Index, Node] is equivalent to RPCBroker.Param[Index].Mult[Node].
***

ParamCount is equivalent to RPCBroker.Param.Count.
***

ParamListCount[Index] is equivalent to RPCBroker.Param[Index].Mult.Count.
### ICPRSState Interface

The ICPRSState interface provides COM objects with basic CPRS context information.
#### Handle function

Format: function Handle: WideString;
This function returns a handle unique to a specific instance of CPRS and is provided for COM objects that may need a unique identifier for each instance of CPRS. The handle is comprised of the TCP/IP address of the workstation, followed by the window handle of the main CPRS window.
#### UserDUZ function

Format: function UserDUZ: WideString;
This function returns the internal entry number to the NEW PERSON file (\#200) for the current CPRS user.
#### UserName function

Format: function UserName: WideString;
This function returns the name of the current user.
#### PatientDFN function

Format: function PatientDFN: WideString;
This function returns the internal entry number to the PATIENT file (\#2) for the currently selected patient.
#### PatientName function

Format: function PatientName: WideString;
This function returns the name of the currently selected patient.
#### PatientDOB function

Format: function PatientDOB: WideString;
This function returns the date of birth for the currently selected patient. The patient’s DOB is displayed in MM/DD/YYYY format.
#### PatientSSN function

Format: function PatientSSN: WideString;
This function returns the social security number of the currently selected patient.
#### LocationIEN function

Format: function LocationIEN: Integer;
This function returns the internal entry number to the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (\#44) for the currently selected location. If no location has been selected this value will be 0.
#### LocationName function

Format: function LocationName: WideString;
This function returns the name of the currently selected location. If no location has been selected this value will be blank.
***

### ICPRSExtension Interface

The ICPRSExtension interface is the only interface that must be implemented by the COM object. The only method of this interface, Execute, is called when the COM object is invoked. After Execute returns, the COM object is released. Note that CPRS execution halts until the Execute method returns. It is important to implement the COM object as an in-process server because CPRS can still process callback events from the windows operating system. Out of process COM objects prevent CPRS from processing these callback events. Without out of process COM objects, CPRS is not be able to timeout and is not able to notify the server of its continued presence (resulting in broker disconnects).
***

#### Execute function

Format: function Execute(const CPRSBroker: ICPRSBroker;
const CPRSState: ICPRSState; const Param1: WideString;
const Param2: WideString; const Param3: WideString;
var Data1: WideString; var Data2: WideString): WordBool;
The CPRSBroker parameter is an object that implements the ICPRSBroker interface and provides access to the CPRS Broker.
The CPRSState parameter is an object that implements the ICPRSState interface and provides basic CPRS state information.
Param1 is the value of the Param1 field of the OE/RR COM OBJECTS file (\#101.15).
Param2 varies depending on how the COM object is being invoked.
For Patient Change events, Param2 is P=PatientDFN.
For Order Accept events, Param2 is O=OrderIdentifier.
For templates, Param2 is blank unless the template is also linked directly to a TIU Title, a Consult, or a Procedure Reason for Request. For Titles, Param2 is T=TitleIEN - pointer to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (\#8925.1). For Consults, Param2 is C=ServiceIEN - pointer to the REQUEST SERVICES file (\#123.5). For Procedures, Param2 is P=ProcedureIEN - pointer to the GMRC PROCEDURE file (\#123.3).
Param3 contains the Passed Value defined for a template. The Passed Value the value contained in the COM PARAM field (\#.18) of the TIU TEMPLATE file (\#8927). If the COM object is not linked to a template, Param3 is blank.
Data1 is used as note or reason for request text by COM objects linked to templates. For templates associated with a specific title or reason for request, Data1 will initially contain the boilerplate text associated with that title or reason for request. All other templates will leave Data1 blank. Data1 is a var parameter, and should be set by the COM object to return note or reason for request text. Note that Data1 is a TStrings.Text value which means that multiple lines are separated by carriage return line feed pairs.
Data2 is reserved for future use, but is anticipated to be used for XML formatted data passed between CPRS and invoked COM objects.
Return Value - the execute function returns a boolean value. For COM objects linked to templates, this return value must be TRUE in order for CPRS to accept any text passed in Data1. Patient and ordering events ignore the return.
***

## Appendix G - Accessibility

### JAWS Files

JAWS is a screen reader application that enables a computer to verbally describe the controls and content of computer applications. For example, in CPRS, when a user changes tabs, JAWS will speak the name of the tab, such as “Orders tab”, enabling the visually-challenged user to navigate CPRS and complete necessary tasks.
Developers have created specialized scripts and CPRS components that enable JAWS to work more effectively with CPRS. As part of the CPRS GUI v.27 (OR\*3.0\*243) release a zip file (CPRS27_JAWS_SUPPORT_FILES.ZIP) including the JAWS scripts and supporting files is being distributed.
The improvements work only with JAWS 7.1 or later. However, JAWS 8.0.2173 or later is best because it fixes a bug that caused CPRS to crash when reading progress notes with JAWS. This fix is not in earlier versions of JAWS 8.0.
Usually it is best for JAWS users stay up to date with the latest releases of the product.
The following files are contained in the CPRS27_JAWS_SUPPORT_FILES.ZIP file:
-   JAWS.SR - DLL used for communication between JAWS and CPRS
-   JAWSUPDATE.EXE - Used to update JAWS 7.1 to work with the component
-   VA508APP.jcf - JAWS configuration file
-   VA508APP.JSS - JAWS script file
-   VA508JAWS.jss - JAWS script file
-   VA508JAWSDispatcher - Application used for communication between JAWS and multiple applications using the JAWS.SR DLL
-   VA508APP.jkm - JAWS keyboard mapping file
-   VA508JAWS.jsd - Documentation companion file to the VA508JAWS.jss script file
-   Vcredist_x86.exe is the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable. It is called by JAWSUpdate.exe.
***

To use the accessibility features, a user must copy these files into Program Files\\Vista\\Common Files, which is normally found on the workstation at C:\\Program Files\\Vista\\Common Files. If the workstation is running JAWS 8.0.2173 or higher, nothing further is required.
If the workstation is running an earlier version of JAWS 8.0, or JAWS 7.1.500, the user must go to Program Files\\Vista\\Common Files and run JAWSUpdate.exe. JAWSUpdate installs a COM object for compatibility with these versions.
**Note:** You must have administrative rights on the machine to run JAWSUpdate.exe.
If the workstation is running a version of JAWS that is older than v 7.1.500, the new accessibility features in CPRS will not function. CPRS will function as it did without these changes, but the following error message will display:
![This dialog displays the message to the user that JAWS needs to be updated to a newer version so that it can work better with CPRS. The version of JAWS that works with the component is JAWS 8.0.2173. After getting this error, JAWS and CPRS run, but the features that make CPRS work better with JAWS will not work.](media/add53fe03ad4a969314deb5d54665e7c.png)
This error message tells users that they need to update to a newer version of JAWS.
***

### New Accessibility Framework

Beginning with CPRS v.27 (OR\*3.0\*243), a new Accessibility Framework was created in CPRS. This includes a new Delphi component, scripts, and other files that enable JAWS and CPRS to work better together. The new component can be used by other developers creating graphical user interface (GUI) applications. The Office of Information Health Data & Informatics (HDI) has custody of this component. To find out more about the component, please contact VHA OI HDI Section 508 Mail group.
## Appendix H – USING NEWPERS DEBUGGER

As part of the OR\*3.0\*596 release 3 Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are updated, a new option (OR NEWPERS DEBUGGER) is added to the OR PARAM COORDINATOR menu (CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)) in addition to a new parameter definition **ORNEWPERS ACTIVE** [“RPC routine ONEWPERS Active”].

### RPC Updates

The following RPC calls are updated with the OR\*3.0\*596 release:
-   ORWU NEWPERS: Used throughout CPRS for selecting a NEW PERSON for various roles. There are approximately 45 entry points for this call.
-   ORWTPP GETCOS: Used in CPRS for designating a default co-signer.
-   ORWU2 COSIGNER: Used in CPRS for designating an Attending Physician for a Discharge Summary.
The ORWU NEWPERS RPC is the most widely used and offers the most variation of required and optional parameters. Using CPRS’s RPC Log allows users to see the actual parameters being passed into the RPC during use.
***

In CPRS, from “Help” -\> “Last Broker Call” opens up CPRS’s RPC Log:
Using the “Find” box, enter ORWU NEWPERS and press \<Enter\>.
![This is an example of the ORWU NEWPERS field. ](media/6e3483570d35b95cd6f954716bd7918b.jpg)
#### Detailed view of “Params” list sent by CPRS with parameters annotated:

The parameter names are not displayed but are added to the graphic below. Parameters are always passed in the same order. CPRS v33 will include a new parameter after the EXCLDE parameter that will indicate whether or not the RPC will include or exclude Non-VA Providers from list boxes.

| EXCLDE    | 1     | If 1, uses OR CPRS USER CLASS EXCLUDE parameter definition value                  |
### OR NEWPERS DEBUGGER

The OR NEWPERS DEBUGGER option prompts the user for CPRS specific parameters that control which users to include in the NEW PERSON list boxes. It uses the same remote procedure call (RPC) as CPRS.
Based on the parameters selected, the debugger displays any reason that a specific user may be excluded from selection in a NEW PERSON list box in CPRS.
