## Introduction

The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) v. 1.0 is a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) software application. CPRS enables clinicians, nurses, clerks, and others to enter, review, and continuously update all information connected with any patient.

Developing a computerized patient record is a long-term goal of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as part of its mission to provide high quality healthcare for America’s veterans. New information needs are emerging as VHA continues to shift into a primary care, ambulatory healthcare delivery model. In the new clinical information environment, all information relevant to treating any given patient will be readily available to healthcare providers, clinical and management decision-makers, educators, and researchers through a secure platform on a need-to-know basis.

With CPRS, care providers can quickly flip through electronic “pages” of the chart to add new orders, review, or add problems, write progress notes, or see results. Alerts, notifications, cautions, warnings, advanced directives, future appointments, demographic data, medications, and orders are all available. Order entry now includes quick orders, order sets, and order checking.

### Purpose and Contents of This Manual

This manual provides technical information about packages installed with CPRS. Packages that integrate with CPRS, but were released prior to the CPRS installation (such as Dietetics, Lab patches, and Radiology), are described in separate package documentation. Pharmacy (Inpatient Meds and Outpatient Pharmacy) and Consult/Result Tracking are installed with CPRS, but have separate Technical and User Manuals. See those manuals for set-up instructions, lists of routines and files, additional technical information, and user information.

## Implementation & Maintenance

See the CPRS Setup Guide for more detailed instructions about planning and setting up CPRS.

### 1. Summary of CPRS Setup

The options on the CPRS Configuration Menus (Clin Coord and IRM) let IRMS staff and Clinical Coordinators set and modify various parameters that control the behavior of the package. These options are described in the following pages of this section.

-   After installation of CPRS, check CPRS parameters to ensure that they are all appropriate for your site (particularly Print parameters)  
-   Set up Pharmacy (Inpatient and Outpatient) parameters (Pharmacy ADPAC). See the CPRS Setup Guide or the Pharmacy Technical Manuals for details  
-   Use Enable or Disable Notification System [ORB3 SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE] on the Notification Mgt Menu on the CPRS Manager Menu to turn on Notifications  
-   Turn on Order Checking and set up its parameters  
-   Use the option Edit Site Local Terms [OCX LOCAL TERM EDIT] on the Order Checking Management Menu to link the lab, radiology, and DNR terms used for order checking to local terms  
-   Review and assign sequence numbers to protocols in the DGPM Movement Events field of the Protocol file  
ITEM: DGOERR NOTE SEQUENCE: 13  
ITEM: FHWMAS SEQUENCE: 14  
ITEM: LR70 MOVEMENT EVENT SEQUENCE: 15  
ITEM: OCX ORDER CHECK PATIENT MOVE SEQUENCE: 16  
ITEM: PSJ OR PAT ADT SEQUENCE: 19  
ITEM: ORU AUTOLIST SEQUENCE: 21  
ITEM: ORU REVIEW DELAYED ORDERS SEQUENCE: 22  
ITEM: ORU PATIENT MOVMT SEQUENCE: 100  
ITEM: OR GUA EVENT PROCESSOR NOTASK SEQUENCE: 999  
-   Assign menus and keys for all packages distributed with CPRS, as described in the CPRS Set-up Guide or the Package Security Guide section of this manual and also the other packages’ Technical Manuals  
-   Review patient and team lists to ensure that they are what you will still use. Add or modify patient or team lists as needed, using options on the Patient/Team List menu  
-   Set up Consult/Request Tracking parameters and the SERVICE/SECTION hierarchy. See the *CPRS Setup Guide* or the *Consult/Request Tracking Technical Manual* for details  
-   Set up the GUI executable (install on client computers [PCs])  
### 2. Patch OR\*2.5\*49

Patch OR\*2.5\*49⎯installed prior to CPRS to help prepare VAMCs for CPRS implementation⎯converts menus, orderable items, generic orders, and quick orders set up locally by sites currently using OE/RR 2.5. The Order Menu Management menu exported with Patch 49 is also on the CPRS Configuration Menu (Clin Coord) on the CPRS Management Menu, and can be used after CPRS is installed to create and edit CPRS orderable items, menus, quick orders, and order sets. Other components of CPRS (Pharmacy, Lab, Radiology, Consult/Request Tracking, etc.) run their own conversions.

Patch 49 begins the transition from the PROTOCOL file (\#101) to new files that have been created to handle the ordering mechanism: ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41), and ORDERABLE ITEMS (\#101.43). Patch 49 installs the data dictionaries. When the patch is installed, these files are automatically populated.

The setup steps for patch 49 in preparation for CPRS include:

-   using options on the Protocol Conversion menu to prepare for conversion of menus to the new CPRS files  
-   conversion of menus  
-   using options on the Menu Management Menu to create or modify menus, quick orders, order sets, etc.  
#### Protocol Conversion

Review the Protocol File, using ORCM REVIEW PROTOCOLS on the Protocol Conversion Utilities menu.

| Review protocol file                    | ORCM REVIEW PROTOCOLS | This option queues three tasks to examine the PROTOCOL (\#101) file for potential problems that may occur with the conversion of protocols to the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file. In addition, a task will be queued to examine the PACKAGE (\#9.4) file for problems with the entries for packages that interface with CPRS. A report of each search will be printed to a selected device.                                                                                                          |
| Convert Protocol Menus to Order Dialogs | ORCM CONVERT MENUS    | This option converts “add order” protocol menus that are currently in use to the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file for use in CPRS. All items on the menus will be converted to this file as well. A mail message will be sent to the individual running the option regarding any protocols that could not be successfully converted.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Locate protocols                        | ORCM FIND PROTOCOL    | This option allows the Clinical Coordinator or IRM staff to see which protocols contain another protocol as an item. This option may be especially useful after the protocol conversion has completed. If one or more protocols must be recreated using the Order Menu Management tools, this option can be used to see where the recreated item should be replaced in the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file.                                                                                           |
| Estimate global growth for CPRS         | ORCM ESTIMATE         | This option estimates the number of outpatient prescriptions that will be backfilled into the ORDER (\#100) file upon installation of CPRS. This figure, along with the current number of entries in the \^OR global and the \^PSRX global, will be used to estimate the amount of global blocks that will be consumed by the installation of CPRS and the subsequent conversion of orders. NOTE: This is only an estimate. There are many variables that can affect the actual space consumption. |
| Order Menu Management                   | ORCM MGMT             | Options on this menu can be used for editing and modifying options and menus for CPRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### Checks and Tasks Triggered When Using ORCM REVIEW PROTOCOLS

##### Extended Action Order Set Check

Patch OR\*2.5\*49 will not convert order sets to the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file in the proper sequence if the COLUMN WIDTH field is defined for the specific protocol. This will check all extended action protocols and report any with this problem. This is a common occurrence if an order set was created as a menu and then changed to an extended action protocol.

##### Corrective Action

Deletes the entry in the COLUMN WIDTH field of the listed protocols. This will not affect the protocol and will keep a problem from occurring when converted to file 101.41.

##### Namespace Check

The conversion of protocols to the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file relies heavily on the national namespaces to convert quick orders. This check will identify protocols that belong to a national package, but begin with a namespace differing from that package.

##### Corrective Action

For conversion of these quick orders to take place, the name must begin with the national namespace of the package to which it belongs.

##### Duplicate Item Check

Generic orders in CPRS can’t use the same item within an order dialog more than once. This check looks at all dialog type protocols and lists any that have an item that is used more than one time in the ITEM multiple.

##### Corrective Action

The duplicate item must be removed or replaced with a similar item with a different name.

##### Package File Check

This check looks at your PACKAGE file and makes sure that the packages required by CPRS are present, have the correct prefixes, and are not duplicated.

##### Corrective Action

Due to the variability of problems and the significance of the PACKAGE (\#9.4) file to proper V*IST*A functioning, the recommendation is to contact National VISTA Support for assistance in correction of any problems.

#### Order Check Expert System

Order Checking and Notifications both rely on a subset of CPRS called the Order Check Expert System. This includes a library of rules, elements, and a data dictionary, as well as facilities to maintain these data sets. Eventually the Expert System may be used for clinicians and others to create rules of their own by combining entities, elements, and rules.

##### How It Works

The Order Check Expert System is based on a set of Rules or Medical Logic Modules (MLM). The term Medical Logic Module, synonymous with rule or frame, is derived from the Arden Syntax, a standard for sharing MLMs and knowledge bases among decision support developers. The Order Check Expert System will support the Arden Syntax and will be able to share knowledge bases with other nonprofit entities.

At this point, the Expert System is mostly used as a compiler and as a tool for monitoring and debugging Order Checking and Notifications. The options on the Order Check Expert System Main Menu can be used to perform these functions.

##### Compiler

The compiler generates routines. The OCX post-install routine runs the compiler to generate an initial set of Order Checking routines. The post-install runs the compiler with default compiler options. One of the options is called Execution Trace. The default for this option is NO. When this option is set to YES, the compiler adds write statements to the compiled code that displays various aspects of the runtime environment. It displays information about the runtime data stream as well as the sequence of line labels as the compiled routine set executes. When this option is set to NO it does not add these additional statements. Adding this extra code makes the compiled routines bigger. However, since the compiler has a routine size limit (4k) imposed on it, it tends to make more routines instead. Thus, you may end up with more routines.

2 Expert System Rule Activate/Inactivate [OCX RULE ACTIVATE]  
3 Edit Site Local Terms [OCX LOCAL TERM EDIT]

#### ORMTIME

ORMTIME is a background processor that is used in conjunction with the ORTASK routines to manage background jobs for order processing. They are intended for IRMS only.

ORMTIME is automatically scheduled once the Orders conversion is done. REQUEUE\^ORMTIME is called from CLEANUP\^OR3CONV1, which occurs when the conversion completes.

The following notifications/alerts are triggered via ORMTIME. If ORMTIME is not running/queued, they will not be sent.

#### ORMTIME Main Menu [ORMTIME MAIN]

This menu contains options that are used for managing ORMTIME.

| Option                          | Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reschedule Background Processor | ORMTIME REQUEUE BACKGROUND JOB | Use this option to Queue or Require ORMTIME. It is safe to run this option if ORMTIME is already queued. There is a check in the queuing code to see if the job is already queued and will not queue another if it finds one already there.                                  |
| Get Background Job Status       | ORMTIME BACKGROUND JOB STATUS  | This option gives a status report of when ORMTIME last ran and also indicates when it is next scheduled to run. It also indicates when each of the seven ORMTIME failsafe jobs are supposed to run.                                                                          |
| Kill all ORMTIME Driven Tasks   | ORMTIME KILL ALL TASKS         | This option is used to stop ORMTIME and all of its failsafe jobs. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS OPTION. There are several Expert System purges that depend on ORMTIME and if ORMTIME is not running then the Expert System will eventually fill up the Volume Set it resides in. |

#### CPRS Clean-up Utilities

This menu contains ORE LAB ORDER CHECKS, which has utilities for checking consistency between lab files and OE/RR files. These utilities can help you clean up some files as you move from OE/RR 2.5 to CPRS.  
**☞ NOTE: The developers intend to add other options to this menu for checking the consistency for other packages.**

#### ORVCO Menu not assigned until New EHR Cutover

This menu is used during the site's New EHR cutover and has menu options to automatically create documents for a single, user selected patient or initiate a task to create a document for any patient that has had an inpatient, outpatient, or clinic visit in the past three years. The menu should not be given out until directed to do so. Someone would need to request this option and also the security key ORVCO needed to use it.

#### Security key: ORVCO

This security key is used to lock the ORVCO menu.

**Note:** When each site transitions to the new EHR, the ORVCO Menu option should be added as a secondary option for HIS/CAC and the ORVCO security key should be assigned to allow the menu to be accessed.

#### Unsigned Orders Search

This option provides the user with three choices to search for unsigned orders. Each search criteria will allow a choice of six sort parameters, a starting date, an ending date, the option to print only the orders summary, and an output device.  
##### Search Criteria Option

**Released/Unsigned:** These are orders that have been released to the service but remain unsigned by the requesting clinician. Only released but unsigned orders will be found using this search option.  
**Unsigned:** These are orders that have not been signed by the requesting clinician, regardless of whether they have been released or not. This option will include all orders displayed in options 1 and 3.  
**Unsigned/Unreleased:** These are orders that have not been released to the service and remain unsigned by the requesting clinician. Only unreleased and unsigned orders will be found using this search option.  
##### Sort Criteria

**Service/Section**: This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders for all service/sections, a single service/section, or multiple selected service/sections.  
**Provider**: This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders associated with all providers, a single provider, or multiple selected providers.  
**Patient**: This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders for all patients, a single patient, or multiple selected patients.  
**Location:** This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders associated with all locations, a single location, or multiple selected locations.  
**Entered By**: This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders entered by all entering persons, a single entering person, or multiple selected entering persons.  
**Division**: This sort will allow the user to find unsigned orders for all divisions, a single division, or multiple selected divisions.  
***

##### Other Criteria

**Starting Date**: Enter the most recent date you would like the search to begin with. For example, if your site has a 48 hours grace period for signing orders, you can ignore those orders placed and left unsigned within the last 48 hours by entering a T-2 or a date/time. Entries in this field follow FileMan conventions.  
**Ending Date**: Enter the oldest date you would like the search to consider. For example, when running this option for the first time, you may want to use the date/time of the installation of CPRS onto your system in order to avoid listing left over orders from the previous version, OERR 2.5. Entries in this field follow FileMan conventions.  
**Print Summary Only**: Enter YES at this prompt to print only the final summary report statistics of the orders count.  
**Device**: The output of this option is formatted for 132-column and will be much easier to read if sent to a device capable of handling 132 or greater columns.

***Starting Date**: Enter the date that you wish to mark the beginning of the search period. This date needs to be earlier than the ending date. Enter an \^ to exit the option. Entries in this field follow FileMan conventions.  
**Ending Date**: Enter the date that you wish to use to mark the end of the search period. This date needs to be more recent than the start date. Enter an \^ to exit the option. Entries in this field follow FileMan conventions.  
##### Output Format

The user has the choice of two output formats: detailed format or columnar format.  
**Detailed format** will provide information from the following fields:  
-   **Order Status**: This field will display the status of the order.  
-   **Order Action**: This field will display the action to be taken on the order. Type a question mark to view a list of possible entries.  
-   **ORIFN**: This is the internal entry number of the order from File 100. This number is equivalent to the ORDER \# in the detailed display while in CPRS. When you use FileMan to edit an order in File 100, type a reverse apostrophe (\`) before the number to jump directly to the order.  
-   **Object of Order**: This is the patient’s name  
-   **SSN**: This will display the last four of the patient’s Social Security number.  
-   **Ordered By**: This will display the name of the user who originated the order.  
-   **Veiled**: Orders placed prior to OERR 3.0 may have this field set to YES which hides the order from the end users. You must use FileMan to set this field to NO in order gain access to it thru CPRS.  
-   **Entered By**: This will display the name of the user who entered the order.  
-   **Released By**: This will display the name of the user who released the order.  
-   **Signed By**: This will display the name of the user who signed the order.  
-   **Order Text**: This will display the text of the order.  
**Columnar format** produces an output similar to the unsigned orders format only with the following headings:  
-   Provider  
-   Patient  
-   SSN  
-   Status  
-   Order \#  
-   Order Date  
-   Signed  
***

##### Additional Search Choices

-   **Output by Service**: Entering a YES at this prompt will allow the user to sort the output by service section for all service sections, a single service, or multiple selected services.  
-   **Specific Service/Section**: Entering a NO at this prompt will, by default, select all services. Entering a YES at this prompt will allow the user to enter a single service or a combination of services  
-   **Device:** When using the columnar format, it is best viewed using a device capable of displaying a 132-column format. The detailed display will work well with an 80-column display.

CPRS Write Access functionality enables an authorized user to permit or restrict write access for each CPRS tab (Problems, Meds, Orders, Notes, Consults, Surgery and Discharge Summary), and for specific functionality within each tab (for example, Encounters and specific Order Display Groups). At the System and Division levels, each site can define the message that will appear when a CPRS user who does not have permission to access a CPRS functionality attempts to perform a write-access.

##### Using CPRS Write Access Settings

During the installation of CPRS Write Access Settings, all Package level settings will be set to Yes, and the Package level error message will be set to “New information cannot be added into CPRS. Exceptions: contact CACs.” A user must set a parameter (setting) to No to restrict functionality. The highest setting is Package and the lowest is User. The lowest setting will take precedence:

-   Package (will not have access to this level at sites unless the site has XUPROG)  
-   System  
-   Division  
-   User

##### Creating a Write Access Error Message

An authorized user can create a Write Access Error Message at the System and Division levels by accessing the CPRS Write Access Editor option. The error message will appear when a user who cannot access a specific functionality attempts to perform a write-access in CPRS.

In the examples below, the CPRS Write Access Error Message is set to “Site-Defined Error Message” for a VAMC and user CPRSPROVIDER,FOUR does not have write-access permissions for Unit Dose medications. Thus, when CPRSPROVIDER,FOUR tries to create a Unit Dose order in CPRS, “Site-Defined Error Message” will display.

## Creating and Updating Orders

The following sections discuss how to create orders for users at the site. These orders include  
-   Generic orders  
-   Various quick orders  
-   Order sets  
There is also a section on how to update orders for indications.  
### Creating Generic Orders

Generic orders are orders created by a Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC) or similar individual at your facility. A CAC creates generic orders using existing dialog definitions and places them on order menus. Because they are based on the dialog definitions, the prompts for each generic order are different.

Generic orders do not follow the Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) rules in that the orders do not work differently for an inpatient location versus an outpatient location. To have generic orders appear under the Clinic Orders display group, users have to define the correct display group. However, when it is defined here, it will always display under Clinic Orders unlike other types of IMO orders.

### CPRS Quick Orders and Order Sets

Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) and others with appropriate access to the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) and the Order Menu Management option can create quick orders. A quick order is an order in which a creator has predefined some or all of the fields for an order. For example, in an inpatient medication quick order, the CAC might define the drug, dosage, route, schedule, and other fields.

Once the order is created, the CAC can assign the quick order to an order menu using the option Order Menu Management \| Enter/edit order menus. Once the item is listed on an order menu, the user can select the quick order.

Using quick orders for frequently ordered items can significantly speed up the ordering process for clinicians. Quick orders can be set up so that they require CPRS to display the order dialog and the user to accept it—giving the provider a chance to review the order. Or, if the creator of the quick order enters all required fields and makes the quick order an auto-accept quick order, CPRS will place the order without displaying the dialog.

Several quick orders can then be combined in an order set. Order sets enable a group of quick orders to be executed in a sequence without having to select each quick order individually. So, for example, three quick orders might be placed in an order set. When the user selects the order set, CPRS would execute the quick orders in the orders that the creator places them in the order sets.

Because the prompts for orders from each package are different, each kind of quick order is slightly different. Quick orders can be created for the following types of orders:

-   Activity  
-   Anatomic Pathology  
-   Blood Products  
-   Clinic Orders  
-   Condition  
-   Consults  
-   Diagnosis  
-   Diet Additional Orders  
-   Diet Orders  
-   Early/Late Trays  
-   General Radiology  
-   Imaging  
-   IV Medications  
-   Laboratory  
-   M.A.S.  
-   Non-VA Medications  
-   Nursing  
-   Outpatient Meals  
-   Outpatient Medications  
-   Precautions  
-   Procedures  
-   Supplies/Devices  
-   Tube feedings  
-   Unit Dose Medications  
-   Vitals/Measurements  
During the creation of quick orders, many prompts are not required. The instructions below are written as if the user was going to enter all the values for the prompts.

#### Creating an Anatomic Pathology Quick Order

**Note:** Anatomic Pathology order dialogs have additional configuration defined in the AP Dialog Config file (\#101.45). Only order prompts, pages and specimens setup in that file can be entered in an AP quick order. These configurations are defined using the Update AP Order Dialogs [ORCM UPDATE AP DIALOGS] option, on the Order Menu Management menu [ORCM MGMT]. This is further detailed in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) OR\*3.0\*569/LR\*5.2\*533 Anatomic Pathology Order Dialog Setup and Configuration Guide, section 4.3 Additional AP Dialog Configuration.

## Ordering Reports and Utilities

The following sections provide information about reports and utilities regarding orders. The following items are covered:

-   IV Medication Quick order Report  
-   Quick Order Reports to Correct Dosages for Order Checks  
-   IV Inpatient Quick Order to Infusion Quick Order Utility  
-   IV Quick Order Additive Frequency Utility  
-   Order Check Override Reason Report  
-   Performance Monitor Report  
### IV Medication Quick Order Report

With CPRS v.27 (patch OR\*3.0\*243), three new fields were added to IV Medication ordering: Route, IV Type, and Schedule. The Route and IV Type are now required for all IV orders. In addition, for Intermittent IV orders, the Schedule field must also be defined. CPRS does not process the orders unless these fields are defined.

Therefore, after CPRS v.27 is installed, sites may have quick orders (QO) that cannot be processed unless they are edited to define the Route, IV Type, and if necessary, the Schedule. To help sites identify which IV medication quick orders need to be edited, CPRS has a new QO Report that is produced upon the installation of CPRS v.27 that shows the IV medication QO that need editing. Additionally, Auto Accept QO are converted from an Auto Accept QO to a non-Auto Accept QO, if they have an invalid data field or fields.

After this report is created when CPRS v.27 installs, the QO Report can be run manually from the “ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT” menu, option ‘MR’ Medication Quick Order Report.

The report is compiled real time and sent to the MailMan mailbox of the requester (if run manually) or the individual installing CPRS v.27 (upon install).

The Quick Order report shows the list of quick orders that need to be edited. Each entry in the list shows the quick order’s internal entry number (IEN), name, display name, and legend. The letters in the legend represent the problem with the quick order. Please see below for a brief explanation of the problem and the required action:

A. Problem: Either the IV type is not defined, or the route is not defined.  
Action: Please edit the IV Type or route fields with the appropriate information.  
B. Problem: The IV type is ‘I,’ but there is no schedule defined.  
Action: For Intermittent IV Orders a schedule is needed to process the order. Enter a schedule for the Intermittent IV dose.  
C. Problem: The IV type is not ‘C’, is not defined, or the rate is not between 1 and 9999.9, a whole number, or ‘@’.  
Action: If the IV Type field is null, the Quick Order needs to be reviewed to determine if this order should be considered a Continuous or Intermittent IV Order. If the IV Type is defined as ‘C’, then the Infusion Rate does not validate. A correct Infusion Rate must be assigned to the Quick Order. The infusion rate must be a number with 1 to 4 digits before the decimal (1-9999) and may have one digit after the decimal, e.g., 9999.9.  
D. Problem: The IV type is ‘I’, but the rate is not a whole number of minutes or hours, but there is something in the rate field.  
Action: A valid “Infuse Over” value must be assigned to the Quick Order. Using the Quick Order Editor, add an “Infuse Over” value in the number of minutes (maximum of 9999).  
E. Problem: The IV limit or duration (limitation) value is defined, but is not a whole number.  
Action: This field is not required but if it exists, it must be a whole number. To correct this, follow the Help Text for the Limitation Prompt in the Quick Order editor for this Quick Order.  
F. Problem: The Order Dialogs with ‘MM’ in the display text.  
Action: MMOL (millimole) has been added as a unit of measure. Please replace ‘MM’ with ‘MMOL.’  
1.  Problem: Auto Accept Quick Order which was ‘Y’es and now set to ‘N’o.  
Action: These Quick Orders were converted from an Auto Accept Quick Order to a non-Auto Accept Quick because they have at least one invalid field. **Please correct the problems identified by the Legend code(s) for the Quick Order before setting the Quick Order back to an Auto-Accept Quick Order.**  
Note: Some examples of valid entries for ‘Rate’ and ‘Limit’. In the examples below Rate and Limit must be whole numbers.  
**‘Rate’:**  
-   ‘**\# ml/hr**’ for number of milliliters per hour, such as 50ml/hr  
-   ‘\#.\# ml/hr,’ such as 100.5 ml/hr  
-   anything with an '@' in it  
-   \# Minutes, such as 90 minutes  
-   \# Hours, such as 2 hours  
**‘Limit’:**  
-   ‘**\#D**’ for number of Days, such as 2D  
-   ‘**\#ML**’ for number of Milliliters, such as 250ML  
-   ‘**\#H**’ for number of Hours, such as 24H  
-   ‘**\#L**’ for number of Liters, such as 5L  
-   ‘**for \# days**’ text for number of days, such as for 3 days  
-   ‘**for a total of \# doses**’ text for number of doses, such as for a total of 4 doses  
-   ‘**with total volume \#L**’ text for total volume in liters, such as with total volume 4L  
-   ‘**with total volume \#ml**’ text for total volume in milliliters, such as with total volume 2000ml  
-   ‘**for \# hours**’ text for number of hours, such as for 6 hours  
**Below is an example of what this report might look like**

### Quick Order Reports to Correct Dosages for Order Checks

CPRS has two quick order reports to help users check on the dosages so that they will function correctly with Medication Order Check HealthCare Application version 2 (MOCHA 2) Dosage Checks. The reports check CPRS quick orders for mixed case and free text dosages so that they can be corrected to comply with a local possible dose on the system. The reports are:

-   Quick Order Mixed-Case Report (OR QO CASE REPORT)  
-   Quick Order Free Text Report (OR QO FREE TEXT)  
#### Quick Order Mixed-Case Report

The accuracy of local dosage setup is vitally important to a site’s success with MOCHA v2.0 Dosage Checks. Dosage and medication route reviews were first introduced with the MOCHA Pre-Implementation patch PSS\*1\*129 in 2009. Additionally, Quick Orders (QO) contain dosages which may need to be updated.

A Quick Order Mixed-Case Report is provided with the OR\*3\*366 patch and will be displayed on the Order Menu Management [ORCM MGMT] menu option. It will identify medication quick orders that are on an ordering menu and contain problematic dosages that do not match any of the Local Possible Dosages (LPD) because of case differences in the drug name. This report specifically looks at Dispense Drugs that have had a change in mixed-case (Tall Man Lettering) since the QO was created.

To run this report, use the follow steps:

1.  In the List Manager interface, if you can enter an option without navigating menus, skip to step 2 or navigate to the option using the following:  
1.  Go to the CPRS Manger Menu by typing ORMGR and pressing \<Enter\>.  
1.  Select the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) by typing PE and pressing \<Enter\>.  
1.  Select the Order Menu Management by typing MM and pressing \<Enter\>.  
1.  Select the option CA Quick Order Mixed-Case Report or type OR QO CASE REPORT and press \<Enter\>.  
1.  At the Device prompt, enter the device where the report should be sent.  
1.  The report will run.

This report identifies quick orders that have potentially had the DRUG name edited such that when the quick order is loaded in CPRS the dosage that is saved with the quick order does not match any of the dosages available for selection in the list. This causes the dosage checks not to be able to be performed correctly. The edit to the drug that this specifically looks for is a case change to the DRUG name. If the name is changed so that it contains different characters that are not just case changes, this report will not identify them.

QO INSTRUCTIONS: 1 TAB(10/40MG) OF AMLODIPINE 10MG/ATORVASTATIN 40MG TAB 1 Quick Orders Found  
##### Purpose of Report

This report is used to identify which Quick Orders will cause the following type of order check message in CPRS until it is corrected:

**Generic Message**  
Maximum Single Dose Check could not be done for Drug: \<\<DRUG NAME HERE\>\>, please complete a manual check for appropriate Dosing.  
**Example Message**  
Maximum Single Dose Check could not be done for Drug: amLODIPine 10MG/ATORVASTATIN 40MG TAB, please complete a manual check for appropriate Dosing.  
**Note:** If there are no results displayed when running this report then there is nothing to update and no further action is required  
##### Example Display in CPRS

The dosage from the drop down box should have been highlighted automatically. Since it is not, this is an indication that the Quick Order is not selecting the dispense drug. This will cause the dosage to be interpreted as a free text dosage and a manual dosing check may be required.

![This screen capture shows the Outpatient Medications dialog with a drug selected, but the dosage drop-down box should have been highlighted and it is not.](media/2875dfa644d31a922293de6fe3631570.png)

##### When does this happen?

This occurs when a site updates a dispense drug name to/from Tall Man Lettering.

**Example of a drug being changed from all capital letters to mixed-case**

##### Is this an issue for all drugs that are changed to/from Tall Man Lettering?

No, this only applies to quick orders when the name of the drug is part of the dose. This name is displayed after the “OF” conjunction (those without a metric dose unit).

##### Example of Quick Order with mixed-cased that will not show up on the report:

**Note:** This example is listed here to explain why a mixed-case dispense drug may not be displayed on the report when you may expect it to be. These will not cause a manual dose check due to mixed-case and thus no editing of the quick order is required.

#### Quick Order Free Text Report

The accuracy of local dosage setup is vitally important to a site’s success with MOCHA v2.0 Dosage Checks. Dosage and medication route reviews were first introduced with the MOCHA Pre-Implementation patch PSS\*1\*129 in 2009. Additionally, Quick Orders contain dosages that may need to be updated.  
A Quick Order Free Text Report is provided in the OR\*3\*366 patch. It will identify medication quick orders that potentially contain problematic dosages that do not match any of the Possible Dosages (PD) or Local Possible Dosages (LPD) that are associated with the defined Orderable Item.  
When a match cannot be determined, then the dose is considered a free text dose. Dosage checks are possible with free text doses, but if improperly formatted they are more prone to Dose Check failures than orders associated with PDs and LPDs. After initial reviews are completed, the reports may be run periodically.  
The Quick Order Free Text Report is designed to be run in a variety of ways, based on the type of quick order (System Level and Personal) and the type of dosage (PD and LPD). The intent is to group similar issues together in order help users to determine if/where an edit needs to occur and to expedite the review process.  
To understand and perform the review process, users must have knowledge of and access to both quick orders and pharmacy dosage setup. As quick order roles and responsibilities vary from site to site, it is anticipated that a collaborative effort between Pharmacy Informatics and Clinical Coordinators will likely be required at most sites.

#### Comparison of System and Personal Type Quick Orders on two Sample Orders

![Screen capture of comparison of System and Personal Type Quick Orders on two sample orders](media/38d58f231665879c1f9305337d89abc6.png)  
##### Dosage Basics for CPRS Displays

*The CPRS dosage list and the Quick Order report share the same display rules*  
For Dosages to display the Dispense Drug must be *marked* and Dosage *assigned* to the same package as the Quick Order *type* being used.  
**If:**  
1.  PDs are *assigned* for Inpatient package *(250MG,500MG,1000MG)*  
1.  LPDs are *assigned* for Outpatient package *(1 CAPSULE, 2 CAPSULES)*  
1.  QO type is for entered for Unit Dose Medications  
**Then:**  
1.  The selectable dosages will be PDs (250MG,500MG,1000MG)  
![This screen capture shows the selectable dosages from the report that has been run.](media/fb16bf1e7411d7fb07ae9beb5bac73c5.png)  
If an orderable item (OI) has multiple dispense drugs, and at least one of those dispense drugs has PDs set for a specific package, then PDs will be the only type of dose that is available for any Quick Order entered for that same package.

If no PD is marked for the package that is being used by a QO, then any available LPDs will display as choices during both CPRS ordering and listed on the QO LPD reports.

Free text doses can be entered on QO’s, but PDs and/or LPDs should be used whenever possible. Free-text rules apply for dosage checks.

##### Dosage Scenarios

The following Quick Orders are all using the Orderable Item: ACETAMINOPHEN TAB which has a single active dispense drug ‘ACETAMINOPHEN 500MG TAB’ *assigned* to the respective package. For each display group (Outpatient Medications and Unit Dose Medications) there is either a ‘FREE TEXT’ dosage or a selected LPD.  
1 PSUZ APAP IP FREE TEXT  
2 PSUZ APAP IP LPD USED  
3 PSOZ APAP OP FREE TEXT  
4 PSOZ APAP OP LPD USED  
Since none of the free text dosages in the QO INSTRUCTIONS match any of the Possible Dosages in the CPRS Dosage List, this report prints all four Quick Orders. Possible Dosages are available for both packages, so any Local Possible Dosages will not be seen.

If available, additional Possible Dosages from other Dispense Drugs(s) tied to the same Orderable Item (*such as ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB*) would be displayed in the CPRS Dosage List. In this example, ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB has Possible Dosages, but is inactive; therefore, none of the Possible Dosages (325MG or 650MG) are showing.

##### Determining Menu(s) of Quick Orders

System Quick Orders that are not placed on a menu will be excluded from this report since a user is not able to order it until it is placed. Personal Quick Orders are not required to be placed on a menu but do require active owner(s).

The *Search/replace components* option allows you to find what menu a quick order is on and either replace or remove the quick order from a menu.

#### Quick Order Report FAQs

**Q: Does this report filter out Personal Quick Orders for Terminated Employees?**  
**A:** The code examines all of the owners of a personal quick order. If all of the owners are inactive (either DISUSERED, TERMINATED, or do not have an access code), the personal quick order will not be listed on the report.  
**Q: Does this report Exclude QO’s not used within specific time frame?**  
**A:** This is not possible because we do not track usage of quick orders. However, a FileMan Report could be created to find these.  
**Q: Does this report screen out QO’s that are not on any active menu?**  
**A:** The code excludes quick orders that are either not on a menu, not a personal quick order, or not part of a reminder dialog.

**Q: How does the dispense drug get chosen? I am seeing several examples of some funny entries with wrong dispense drugs:**

CPRS DOSAGE LIST:

300MG  
**A:** CPRS builds a list of dispense drugs associated with an orderable item. In this case the OI comes from the quick order so we build the list of dispense drugs and since this is a free text entry we can’t determine what the dispense drug is yet on the CPRS side. So any dispense drugs under that OI show on this report but do not necessarily reflect the dispense drug sent to pharmacy, it is a best guess.  
**Q: Is there any way to tell who created the quick orders? I’d like to know if anyone still uses them or not.**  
**A:** It doesn’t store who created the quick order, but there is a way to determine if it is on a user’s list.

**Q: Is there a way to determine which quick orders are on a user’s list?**  
**A:** Yes – By using the Order Menu Management menu option you can see all personal quick orders by a user  
**Q: If you edit the dose on a Quick Order, it removes the information below the field. How is this issue addressed?**  
**A:** You have to review each quick order entirely and then perform the edit, . See example below:

#### Free Text Formatting

##### Basic logic for successful dose checks when using free text doses

*The following logic can be used to ensure free text dose entries perform dose checks, but may not prevent quick orders from appearing on this report.*  
Compatible Free Text Logic - will generate a successful dosing check

-   Whole numbers (2, two) followed by a valid dose unit (mg, tablet)  
-   Numbers with decimal points and commas (10.5, 1,000)  
-   Sequential Ranges (2-3, 2 – 3, 2 or 3, two to three, two or three, two-three, two – three)  
-   Fractions (1 and ½, one and one half, one and one-half, 1 and one half, 1 and one-half)  
***

Incompatible Free Text Logic - will generate a manual dose check alert

-   More than one space between the numeric value and the dose unit  
-   Trailing spaces or additional trailing data (10mg\<space\>)  
-   Special characters (- &/) and extraneous textual information  
-   Fractions less than ¼ or greater than 10 and ½  
-   Ranges greater than 10 (10-11)  
-   Non-sequential ranges (1-3, 2-5)  
-   Metric ranges (1mg-2mg, 1mL-2mL)  
**Examples**  
| **Valid Format** | **Invalid Format**                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 10mg             | 10mg\<space\>                                 |
| 10 mg            | 10 mg (has 2 spaces between text)             |
| 10mL             | 1 tablet (*has 2 spaces*)                     |
| 1 tablet         | 10mg (1 tablet) or 10mg (10mL) or 10mg/10mL\* |
| 1tablet          |                                               |

*\*This format will only work if a Local Possible Dosage is created. Name the Local Possible Dosage with the full text, but define the numeric dose (10) and dose unit (mg)*  
#### Quick Order Free Text Report Checklist

Review your hospital’s quick order policies prior to editing System Quick Orders.

Determine an action plan for editing Personal Quick Orders, whether the edit will be performed directly by the provider or alternatively via the Edit Personal Quick Orders by User option

Run each of the following report combinations:

-   Personal Quick Orders  
-   Local Possible Dosages  
-   Possible Dosages  
-   No Local Possible and No Possible Dosages  
-   System Quick Orders  
-   Local Possible Dosages  
-   Possible Dosages  
-   No Local Possible and No Possible Dosages  
For each Quick Order that displays on the report, look into Orderable Item and Drug File to determine what packages the Dispense Drug(s) and available dosages are marked/assigned to.

Review available/applicable Possible Dosages and Local Possible Dosages

Assign the most appropriate dosage to the Quick Order.

-   In some cases an existing Possible Dosage or Local Possible Dosage can be selected  
-   In some cases the existing Local Possible Dosage may need to be edited to a format that is compatible with MOCHA Dosage Checks, and then the Quick Order dosage can also be updated  
-   In some cases a new Possible Dosage or Local Possible Dosage may need to be added to the Drug File \#50  
-   In some cases, the most appropriate dosage will be the one that already exists on that Quick Order, and no change is needed  
-   In some cases a new free text dose will need to be entered. Ensure that a compatible free text format is used whenever possible  
If a drug file edit is required, then other Quick Orders associated with that dispense drug or orderable item may also be affected by the edit. You may consider running a FileMan to identify the other Quick Orders using the drug.

**NOTE**: Not all Quick Orders listed on the report represent MOCHA Dose Check issues; they simply reveal mismatches between doses in quick orders and locally available possible and/or local possible dosages, which is a common cause for manual dose checks alerts.  
### Convert IV Inpatient Quick Order to Infusion Quick Order

The new option Convert IV Inpatient QO to Infusion QO [OR CONVERT INP TO QO] is now on the ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT [ORCM MENU] menu. This option enables CACs at sites to convert an IV quick order that is set up as an Inpatient quick order to the new Infusion quick order format.

This option has three selections to convert quick orders:

-   QUICK ORDERS USED IN OTHER ITEMS (in order menus, order sets, or reminder dialogs)  
-   QUICK ORDERS NOT USED IN OTHER ITEMS (quick orders not assigned to order menus, order sets, or reminder dialogs)  
-   SPECIFIC QUICK ORDER  
Each option prompts for information to convert one quick order at a time. If the user wants to convert all the quick orders that are assigned to order menus, order sets, or a reminder dialog first, the user will select the QUICK ORDERS USED IN OTHER ITEMS prompt.

If the user wants to convert quick order that are NOT assigned to an order menu, order sets, or a reminder dialog, the user will select the QUICK ORDERS NOT USED IN OTHER ITEMS prompt.

If the user wants to convert specific quick orders, the user will select the SPECIFIC QUICK ORDER prompt.

#### Personal Quick Order Exception

This utility will not convert personal IV quick orders. However, after it has converted the quick orders that it can convert, the utility will then list the personal IV quick orders by user. The user running the utility can copy this information and forward this information in a mailman message. The utility will completely ignore any personal quick order assigned to a terminated user.

#### Criteria to Convert IV Quick Orders

To be converted to an Infusion quick order, the order needs to meet the following conditions:  
1.  The quick order must have the Inpatient Medication dialog [PSJ OR PAT OE] as the default dialog.  
1.  The orderable item assigned to the quick order must have the IV BASE field defined as “Yes” or the IV ADDITIVE fields defined as “Yes”.  
#### Conversion Process Overview

There are two parts to the conversion process. The first part is a set of questions that populate the minimum fields needed to convert to the Infusion quick order. The second part puts the user in the standard quick order editor where the user can add any additional Infusion quick order information if needed.

##### Part One: Minimum Conversion Prompts

Once the process is started, for each quick order, the user will see a detailed description of the quick order. Then, the user is presented with the following prompt:

Convert the above Quick Order to an Infusion Quick Order?  
Select one of the following:  
Y YES  
N NO  
S SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Convert?:  
Answering “Yes” begins the conversion process.

Answering “No” does not begin the process for the specified order, but the conversion option then moves on to the next quick order.

The next prompt determines the IV Type:

Select the IV Type for this Quick Order.  
Select one of the following:  
C CONTINUOUS  
I INTERMITTENT  
S SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
IV TYPE:  
This prompt is used to define the IV Type value that should be assigned to the infusion quick order.

The next prompt is dependent on the orderable item set up.

Change orderable item NAME to an additive?  
Select one of the following:  
Y YES  
N NO  
S SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Convert to Additive?:  
This prompt will only appear if both the IV BASE and IV ADDITIVE fields are set to “Yes.”

If only the IV BASE field is set to “Yes,” the user will not see this prompt, and the orderable item will automatically be assigned to the solution value of the Infusion quick order.

If only the IV ADDITIVE field is set to “Yes,” the user will see the following message:

Orderable item NAME is not marked as a solution.
This orderable item will be moved to the additive value.  
The IV BASE and IV ADDITIVE fields control in which list box the orderable item should appear in the Infusion order dialog. The user should not be able to override these values when converting the quick order to an infusion quick order.

The next prompt lists the changes that the user has selected and asks the user if CPRS should continue and convert the quick order.

Please confirm the selected changes below.  
If these changes are accepted, the Quick Order will be converted to an Infusion Quick Order.  
This Quick Order will not be able to be converted back to an Inpatient Quick Order.  
Convert to Infusion Quick Order: YES  
IV TYPE: Intermittent  
Change orderable item MORPHINE INJ to an additive: YES  
Select one of the following:  
Y YES  
N NO  
S SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Confirm Changes?:  
Up to this point, the user has the option to Skip this Quick Order and not convert the quick order by selecting the SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER prompt. Also, the user has the option to stop the entire process and exit the conversion option by selecting the QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY prompt.

**Warning:** If the user enters “Yes” at this prompt, the IV quick order will be converted to an infusion quick order, and it CANNOT be converted back to inpatient medication quick order.  
##### Conversion Warning Messages

After the conversion process, the user may see up to two warning messages.  
**Check the strength associated with the additive value in the editor.** This warning message displays if the orderable item is converted to the additive value. When this conversion is done, the conversion utility may be unable to select the correct additive strength from the inpatient quick order, so the user will need to select the strength in the editor.  
**Check the limitation value assigned to the quick order in the editor.** This warning message displays if the inpatient medication order is a complex order with a duration defined. In this case, the infusion quick order can have only one duration value, and the user may need to adjust the value—especially if there was more than one duration value defined in the complex inpatient quick order.  
Part Two: Filling in Additional Fields in the Quick Order Editor

When the minimum conversion is done, the conversion utility places the user into the standard quick order editor. At this point, the user can walk through the quick order editor to verify that the values are correct in the Infusion quick order. If corrections are needed, the user can make corrections. In addition, the user can add values, as needed, to the other Infusion quick order fields.  
If the user does not need to make changes to the quick order after the conversion is done, it is still recommended that user walk all the way through the quick order in the editor. If the user exits out of the editor without going all the way through, then the fields that are specific to the inpatient medication dialog will not be removed from the quick order. This should have no impact on CPRS, but it can cause confusion if there is a need to debug the quick order at a later time.  
**Note:** Both the IV BASE and the IV ADDITIVE fields’ values are populated from the USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY prompt in the corresponding files: the IV SOLUTIONS file, file \#52.7, and the IV ADDITIVES file, file\# 52.6. When the USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY prompt is edited in one of these files, an update is sent to the CPRS ORDERABLE ITEM file, file\# 101.43. There may be a delay in this update and this delay can affect the conversion option. If the USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY value is not set to “Yes”, then the quick orders that point to these items will be skipped by this conversion utility. The user will still be able to place the order in CPRS using the current quick order format. However, if pharmacy finishes the order as an IV order, then the CPRS user will NOT be able to take an action (Copy, Change, or Renew) on the order in CPRS.  
### Update IV Quick Order Additive Frequency Utility

The new option IV Additive Frequency Utility [OR IV ADD FREQ UTILITY] is now on the ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT [ORCM MENU] menu. This option enables CACs at sites to define a value for the additive frequency field for continuous IV quick orders.

This option has three selections to convert quick orders:

-   QO ASSIGNED TO ORDER MENUS, ORDER SETS, OR REMINDER DIALOGS  
-   QO NOT ASSIGNED TO ANY OF THESE ITEMS (quick orders not assigned to order menus, order sets, or reminder dialogs)  
-   SPECIFIC QUICK ORDER (to change a specific quick order that the user knows needs to be changed)  
Each option prompts for information to convert one quick order at a time. If the user wants to convert all the quick orders that are assigned to order menus, order sets, or a reminder dialog first, the user will select the QO ASSIGNED TO ORDER MENUS, ORDER SETS, OR REMINDER DIALOGS prompt.

If the user wants to convert quick order that are NOT assigned to an order menu, order sets, or a reminder dialog, the user will select the QO NOT ASSIGNED TO ANY OF THESE ITEMS prompt. If the user wants to convert specific quick orders, the user will select the SPECIFIC QUICK ORDER prompt.

#### Personal Quick Order Exception

This utility will not convert personal IV quick orders. However, after it has converted the quick orders that it can convert, the utility will then list the personal IV quick orders by user. The user running the utility can copy this information and forward this information in a mailman message. The utility will completely ignore any personal quick order assigned to a terminated user.

#### Criteria to Update IV Quick Orders with This Utility

To be converted to an Infusion quick order using this utility, the order needs to meet the following conditions:

1.  The quick order must have the IV Medication dialog [PSJI OR PAT FLUID OE] as the default dialog.  
1.  The quick order must have at least one Additive defined.  
1.  It must not have values defined for the associated additive frequency fields.  
#### Conversion Process Overview

There are two parts to the conversion process. The first part enables the user to set the value for the additive frequency. The second part puts the user in the standard quick order editor where the user can add any additional information to the Infusion quick order.

##### Part One: Minimum Conversion Prompts

Once the process is started, for each quick order, the user will see a detailed description of the quick order. Then, the user is presented with the following prompt:

Add additive frequency to the above Quick Order?  
Select one of the following:  
Y YES  
N NO  
K SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Add additive frequency?:  
Answering “Yes” begins the conversion process.  
Answering “No” does not begin the process for the specified order, but the conversion option then moves on to the next quick order.  
The next prompt displays the Additive value and the default additive frequency defined for the additive in the Pharmacy package. If a default value is defined, then it will be the default for the question "Select Additive Frequency:"  
Additive: ACETAZOLAMIDE INJ  
Default value: All Bags  
Select one of the following:  
A ALL Bags  
1 1 Bag/Day  
S See Comments  
K SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Select Additive Frequency: All Bags//  
The next prompt lists the changes that the user has selected and asks the user if CPRS should update the quick order.

Please confirm the selected changes below.  
If these changes are accepted, the Quick Order will be updated  
Additive: ACETAZOLAMIDE INJ  
Additive Frequency: ALL Bags  
Additive: MULTIVITAMINS INJ  
Additive Frequency: 1 Bag/Day  
Additive: MORPHINE INJ  
Additive Frequency: ALL Bags  
Select one of the following:  
Y YES  
N NO  
K SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER  
Q QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY  
Confirm Changes?:  
Up to this point, the user has the option to Skip this Quick Order and not convert the quick order by selecting the SKIP THIS QUICK ORDER prompt. Also, the user has the option to stop the entire process and exit the conversion option by selecting the QUIT THE CONVERSION UTILITY prompt.

**Warning:** If the user enters “Yes” at this prompt, the IV quick order will be updated immediately. If a mistake is made, the user will need to go into the quick order editor and correct the quick order manually.  
##### Part Two: Filling in Additional Fields in the Quick Order Editor

When the minimum conversion is done, the conversion utility places the user into the standard quick order editor. At this point, the user can walk through the quick order editor to verify that the values are correct in the Infusion quick order. If corrections are needed, the user can make corrections. In addition, the user can add values, as needed, to the other Infusion quick order fields.

**Note:** Even if the user feels that there is no need to make changes to the quick order after the conversion is done, it is still recommended that the user review the entire contents of the quick order in the editor. This is a chance to see that the order is complete and correct.  
### Order Check Override Reason Report

When a user receives a critical order check, the user must enter an override reason before CPRS accept the order. Developers created a report to enable users to review the critical order check override reasons. The report can contain the following types of data DATE/TIME ORDERED, DIVISION, DISPLAY GROUP, ORDER CHECK, & OVERRIDDEN BY.

The report will be sorted in *ascending* order by any combination of these fields depending on what search option is chosen. The following options are available:

Select one of the following:  
1 DATE/TIME ORDERED & OVERRIDDEN BY  
2 DATE/TIME ORDERED & ORDER CHECK  
3 DATE/TIME ORDERED & DIVISION  
4 DATE/TIME ORDERED & DISPLAY GROUP  
5 DATE/TIME ORDERED, DIVISION, & DISPLAY GROUP  
The following sort orders correspond to the chosen search options:

1.  Date/Time Ordered, Division, Display Group, Order Check, & Order \#.  
1.  Order Check, Division, Display Group, Date/Time Ordered, & Order \#.  
1.  Division, Display Group, Order Check, Date/Time Ordered, & Order \#.  
1.  Display Group, Division, Order Check, Date/Time Ordered, & Order \#.  
1.  Date/Time Ordered, Division, Display Group, Order Check, & Order \#.  
There are two types of reports: summary and delimited. The delimited report is formatted such that it can be exported to a text file, which with a little work can then be imported into an Excel spreadsheet.

The header of every report whether summary or delimited will display the following information:

-   the CURRENT USER who ran the report  
-   the CURRENT DATE/Time when the report was run  
-   the DATE RANGE of the Date/Time Ordered to be searched  
Other search criteria will be displayed as well depending on which search option the user selects. For example, for option 1, the name of the person who overrode the order check and his/her title will be displayed, for option 2, the type of order check will be displayed, etc. Below is an example of the header for option 1:

Order Check Override Reason Report  
Sorted in Ascending order by:  
Date/Time Ordered, Division, Display Group, Order Chk, & Order\#  
Current User: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN Current Date: May 21, 2007@11:59:04  
Date Range Searched: May 21, 2006 - May 21, 2007 WHERE  
Order Chks are Overridden By: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN  
Title: PHYSICIAN  
If a search finds no records, the message “NO RECORDS FOUND!” is displayed.

#### Running Order Check Reason for Override Reports

Users can create either the summary report or the delimited report. If the user plans to export the data to a text file that can be used, the user should follow the steps under Creating a Delimited Report. The user should be aware that some additional work is required to import that data in an Excel spreadsheet for example.

##### Creating a Summary Reason for Override Report

1.  Select the Order Check Override Reason Report option [ORK ORD CHK OVERRIDE REPORT] from the Order Checking Mgmt Menu [ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU].  
1.  At the *FILTER SEARCH by: 1//* prompt, select the appropriate number for the kind of report you want (a number between 1 and 5) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the SEARCH Orders Beginning prompt:, enter the beginning date (the date in the past to begin from) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the Thru: prompt, enter the ending date for the search (how close to the present) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At this point, each report option will present different prompts. For the report type selected, enter the appropriate responses (users can always type two question marks and press \<Enter\> to get a list of possible selections, although this list can be quite long):  
-   At option 1’s *SEARCH Order Chks Overridden By:* prompt, enter the name of the person who overrode the order checks that you want to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 2’s Select ORDER CHECKS NAME: prompt, type the name of the order check to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 3’s Select MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION NAME: prompt, type the name of the division to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 4’s Select DISPLAY GROUP NAME: prompt, type the name of the Orders tab display group to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At options 5’s Select MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION NAME: prompt, type the name of the division to review and press \<Enter\>, then at the Select DISPLAY GROUP NAME: prompt, type the name of the Orders tab display group and press \<Enter\>.  
1.  At the *Print delimited output only? NO//* prompt, accept the default by pressing **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the *DEVICE: HOME//* prompt, do one of the following:  
-   To print to the terminal screen, accept the default of ‘HOME’ by pressing \<Enter\>.  
-   To directly print or queue to a network printer, type the network printer name or ‘Q’ followed by the network printer name, respectively and press \<Enter\>.  
-   To print to a spooler, select a spool/spooler and then enter the spool document name and press \<Enter\>.  
-   To print to a host file, type ‘HFS’ and then type the host file name and press \<Enter\>.  
1.  If printing to the terminal screen, once the report has completed printing, press **\<Enter\>** to exit at the prompt, *Report Completed. Please Press ENTER to EXIT:*.  
Creating a Delimited Reason for Override Report

Users can export a delimited report, one that uses a character, space, or tab to signify each piece of data, so that the data can be used in an outside application, such as Excel. This section contains instructions on how to create a delimited report, how to export that report, and how to import the report into Excel. Most steps are the same for each kind of report, but because prompts are different, some of the steps may be different as well.

Listed below are two methods for exporting the data to a text file. There are two ways that the user can export the delimited report depending on the user’s preference: A) export all the fields and dialog in between into one text file or B) export the non-word processing fields into one text file and then export each of the three remaining word processing fields in their own text files.

Both methods will require the user to clean up the text file for easy importation into Excel. The user will have to:

-   Scan over all the delimited records (especially those of the word-processing fields) and make sure they all print on one line  
-   Ensure that they all have the same number of records before importation, which will ensure that every record will be related in the table and makes it easier to manipulate once imported.  
-   Clean up the dialog prompts in between and after the delimited sections  
-   Remove the report title and header from the text files before importing (the user can choose to keep those items)  
**NOTE:** DO NOT copy and paste the delimited sections directly off the terminal screen. A right margin of 80 columns will retain and transfer into the text file and will cause most of the records to wrap to the next line. This will require more work for the user to fix and clean up so that each record falls on one line and imports nicely.  
1.  Select the Order Check Override Reason Report option [ORK ORD CHK OVERRIDE REPORT] from the Order Checking Mgmt Menu [ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU] and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the FILTER SEARCH by: 1// prompt, select the appropriate number for the kind of report you want (a number between 1 and 5) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the SEARCH Orders Beginning prompt:, enter the beginning date (the date in the past to begin from) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the Thru: prompt, enter the ending date for the search (how close to the present) and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At this point, each report option will present different prompts. For the report type selected, enter the appropriate responses (users can always type two question marks and press \<Enter\> to get a list of possible selections, although this list can be quite long):  
-   At option 1’s *SEARCH Order Chks Overridden By:* prompt, enter the name of the person who overrode the order checks that you want to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 2’s Select ORDER CHECKS NAME: prompt, type the name of the order check to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 3’s Select MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION NAME: prompt, type the name of the division to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At option 4’s Select DISPLAY GROUP NAME: prompt, type the name of the Orders tab display group to review and press \<Enter\>.  
-   At options 5’s Select MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION NAME: prompt, type the name of the division to review and press \<Enter\>, then at the Select DISPLAY GROUP NAME: prompt, type the name of the Orders tab display group and press \<Enter\>.  
1.  At the Print delimited output only? NO// prompt, type YES and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the Specify REPORT DELIMITER CHARACTER: U// prompt, select a delimiter to use in the report: P for Pipe, T for Tilde, or U for Up Arrow and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the DEVICE: HOME// prompt, enter in ‘;300;9999’ and DO NOT press \<Enter\> yet.  
**Note:** A right margin of 255 or greater will ensure that every record gets printed on a line without any wrapping unless the word processing field is greater than 255 characters.  
Exporting and Importing a Delimited Report Using a Single Text File

1.  Capture the report or incoming data (for example, in KEA!, the user would select Tools \| Capture Incoming Data) before pressing \<Enter\> and save it as a text file under a meaningful name (i.e., DELIMITRPT.TXT) and location that you will remember.

### Performance Monitor Reports

The Performance Monitor Reports option on the Clinical Coordinator menu produces reports that can be used to monitor overall physician order entry to show whether physicians are entering their own orders.

The logic for determining whether a provider entered his or her own order has changed slightly. A provider must hold the ORES key in order to be included on the report. By checking for the existence of the ORES key certain providers, such as fee basis providers or any other outside providers that might adversely affect the overall hospital compliance with provider-entered orders, do not appear on the report.

In addition, the report previously counted the order as being entered by the provider if the ENTERED BY field of the ORDERS file also held the ORES key. Now, the ENTERED BY field and the PROVIDER field must match.

**Note:** For consistency, the ORES key should not be deleted when a user is no longer an active user on the system.  
The Performance Monitor provides four reports:

-   Detail report  
-   Summary report  
-   Both (includes the Detail and Summary report)  
-   Summary Report Totals Only (shows only the totals for the selected group of providers but does not list providers individually)  
To improve accuracy of the reports, the report filters out test patients. Also, the Performance Monitor now filters out Non-VA medication entries.

Changes were made to the information displayed in the Summary and Summary Report Totals Only options to better represent the orders that the provider could have entered directly. The changes will be discussed in the sections describing those reports.

Sites can use the Summary Report Totals Only to quickly obtain the numbers that are sent to Office of Quality Management.

#### Detail Report Format

The Detail report provides a list of all orders connected with each provider known as the “universe of orders.” The universe of orders refers to all orders for which the provider has been identified in the PROVIDER field of the ORDERS file.

The Detail report is first sorted alphabetically by provider name. Under each provider’s listing, the report includes an entry for each order in the date range specified. The entries are listed earliest to most recent.

Each entry under the provider’s name includes the following information:

-   order date  
-   order number  
-   patient identification  
-   first orderable item  
-   order type  
-   patient location  
-   package  
-   whether the order was entered by an individual having the ORES key  
The first orderable item can help identify orders when more than one order was given for the same patient on the same date. Order Type indicates whether the order was submitted as a written, verbal, telephone, electronic, or policy. The ORD TYPE column will include an abbreviation indicating the type. The abbreviations are

-   WRI for written orders  
-   TEL for telephone orders  
-   VER for verbal orders  
-   ELE for electronic orders  
-   POL for policy orders

#### Performance Monitor Summary Reports Format

The CPRS Performance Monitor reports include two summary reports.

• The Summary report gives a summary for each provider selected and includes a total for the selected group on the bottom of the report.  
• The Summary Report Totals Only shows only the totals for the providers selected as a group rather than listing individual providers.  
The format for these reports has changed slightly.

Changes to the Summary Format

The Performance Monitor summary reports have been modified to better represent which orders physicians can enter directly and which they would not enter directly. Below is a simple capture that shows the report format.

TOTAL 20 1/0/0 19 12 63% 4/2/0/1  
The Provider column shows the name and the rows for Inpatient, Outpatient, and Subtotal.

The Universe column introduces the concept of a “universe of orders.” The universe of orders refers to all orders for which the provider has been identified in the PROVIDER field of the ORDERS file.

In the next column under the heading DEA/STU/POL, three new exceptions have been added to identify those orders that the provider would not be expected to enter directly. The exceptions are as follows:

• outpatient pharmacy orders for which the DEA requires a wet signature  
• orders entered by students  
• policy orders  
For the student exception in this report, a student will be a user who has either the PROVIDER CLASS field (53.5) of the NEW PERSON file (200) set to STUDENT or has had a user class (or subclass) of STUDENT assigned through the Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU) software.

**☞ NOTE: For consistency, it is recommended that you assign an expiration date for a user class rather than deleting or removing the user class from the user when the class no longer applies.**  
The Providers Orders column represents the number of orders that a provider could have entered directly. To get the number in this column, the DEA, student, and policy orders are subtracted from the universe of orders.

The Provider Entered column shows how many orders the provider entered directly.

The % column expresses the ratio of orders entered as a percentage (Provider entered/ provider ordered). The word "NONE" may also appear in the % column. "NONE" indicates that the provider had no orders during the selected time frame, which is different than having a 0%, which indicates that they did not enter any of their own orders.

The Breakdown column shows the nature of order for those orders not directly entered by the provider. There are four groups represented here: Written (WR), Verbal (VE), Telephone (TE) and Electronically Entered (EL). Previously, policy orders were shown in this column but as stated above they are now on the exceptions side of the report.

#### Summary Report

Like the Detail Report, the Summary Report sorts the data by provider first. For each provider, it displays the total number of orders for which the provider is responsible (the universe) for the selected time period, the exceptions broken down by category (DEA/Student/Policy), the number of orders the provider could have entered, the number actually entered by the provider, the percentage (actual/possible), and the breakdown of orders not self-entered by category: WR indicates written orders, VE indicates verbal orders, TE indicates telephone orders, EL indicates electronic orders.

## Copy/Paste Reports and Parameters

This section discusses several areas about how CPRS tracks text that is pasted into clinical documents. Specifically, it addresses:

-   What does CPRS define as copied and pasted text and which areas within CPRS where text or data that is copied will be tracked?  
-   What parameters govern copy/paste actions?  
-   What reports are available and what is contained in the reports.  
### What does CPRS Define as a Copy and Paste?

CPRS can recognize several sources from Vista or CPRS that users might copy data from and then paste it into a clinical document. The areas are the following:

-   Cover Sheet Tab (Active Problems, Allergies / Adverse Reactions, Postings, Active Medications, Clinical Reminders, Lab Results, Appointments/Visits/Admissions),  
-   Meds Tab (Med details, Med admin report)  
-   Notes Tab (Note details, View Template Notes)

### Copy/Paste Parameters in VistA

This parameter defines how pasted text is displayed in a note:

-   **Copy/Paste Identifier (ORQQTIU COPY/PASTE IDENT).** This parameter is defined by the user in CPRS using Tools \| Options \| Notes. The user can choose Underline, Italics, Bold, or Highlight (with its color selection) or any combination of the four attributes.  
Several parameters that determine what is considered text that is pasted into CPRS are set under the TIU BASIC EDIT option:

-   **Minimum Copy/Paste:** This parameter determines the number of words necessary for CPRS to consider the text to be pasted and mark it. For example, if this number is set at 20 words and the user pastes only 19, CPRS will not display that as pasted text. The default is 5 words unless changed by your site.  
-   **Copy/Paste Verify Percentage:** Because providers often edit text after it is pasted, this parameter enables sites to determine what percentage of the original paste must be in the document to be considered pasted. For example, if this percentage is set at 85 percent and the user pastes some text but then edits it so that only 75 percent of the original text remains, it will not display as pasted text. The default is 90% unless changed by your site.  
-   **Days to Store Copy Text:** Sites can use this parameter to specify how many days text that was copied from within VistA should be stored so that it can be considered a paste. If the sites set it for 7 days, the text will be stored for 7 days and compared to any paste that occurs into a clinical document. For example, this determines how long the copied text is stored. If this is set at 5 days, the text that was copied from VistA will be stored and compared for a past for up to 5 days to show that it was pasted. The default is 7 days unless you site changes it.  
-   **Userclass to View Copy/Paste:** With this parameter, sites can designate which user classes can view pasted text in clinical documents. Sites can add user classes that can view the pasted text to the two default groups: Chief of MIS and Privacy Act Officer. The default groups are Chief of MIS and Privacy Act Officer. Those who can view the pasted text will see it in their own notes if they create them. The items in the pane will read “New” until the note is saved and will then be replaced with the date/time. Also, the text they paste will only display as such when pasted, but not when the note is then further edited. It will again show as pasted text after the note is saved.  
To exclude a note title from being tracked by the copy/paste feature, CACs or others can set the following by using the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER EDIT option:

-   **Exclude from Copy/Paste:** This parameter allows sites to exclude the document titles they designate from being tracked by the copy and paste features. No title are excluded unless your site adds them.  
Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) set the values for these parameters.

### Detailed and Summary Copy/Paste Reports

Two reports enable sites to review the items that have been pasted into clinical documents:

-   Copy/Paste Tracking Detail Report: The detail report lists for the dates the user specified and whether the report is for all patients or an individual patient. The entry for each paste then contains the following information:  
-   Pasted Date/Time  
-   Copy Patient  
-   Paste Patient  
-   Copy Date/Time  
-   Copy Author  
-   Copy Document Title  
-   Paste Patient  
-   Paste Date/Time  
-   Paste Provider  
-   Paste Document Title  
-   Paste Percentage  
-   Actual Percentage  
-   Original Pasted Text  
**The report would look something like the following although this is for a single note**

## HIPAA Code Set Versioning (CSV)

Code set versioning (CSV) modifies VistA to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulations that diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the time the service was provided. Because the codes change, CPRS currently checks ICD and CPT code validity as of a specified date when codes are entered, when a new code set is implemented, and whenever Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) or IRM personnel choose to run the option.

CPRS GUI users will see indicators for inactive codes on the Cover Sheet, Problems tab, Encounter form, and in Clinical Reminders (although the Clinical Reminders changes may be less apparent).

In the CPRS List Manger software, a protocol and an option have been created to identify potential problems with inactive diagnoses or procedures codes in consults or procedures quick orders. These provisional diagnoses are predefined in Consult and Procedure Quick Order Dialogs.

The first protocol, ORCM GMRC CSV EVENT, as shown in the capture below, is a background job that is activated when a new ICD9 code set version is implemented. This protocol checks consults and procedures quick orders for inactive codes or codes that will become inactive. It then puts the information in a MailMan message that is sent to the mail group ORCM CSV EVENT.

NAME: ORCM GMRC CSV EVENT  
ITEM TEXT: Quick order code set version event  
TYPE: action CREATOR: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN  
PACKAGE: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING  
DESCRIPTION: This protocol will be invoked by the ICD event protocol upon installation of a new code set version. The protocol will be responsible for generating a mail message to a mail group containing any consult or procedure quick orders that have provisional diagnoses with inactive ICD9 codes or codes that will be inactivated in the future.  
ENTRY ACTION: D CSVPEP\^ORCMGMCK TIMESTAMP: 59239,49834  
CACs can manually run the option, ORCM GMRC CSV CHECK, at any time to check for any inactive consults or procedures codes in quick orders. Running this option will create a report with provisional diagnoses or procedure codes in consults and procedure quick orders. Here is the description of the option:

| 100.02  | NATURE OF ORDER                      | This file should not be added to or deleted from. It determines the actions that are to be taken based on the nature of an order or change to an order. The file is initially populated with data that seems the most appropriate. Sites may find it necessary to change some of the fields for entries in this file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 100.03  | ORDER REASON                         | This file is used to define the possible reasons for DC/ing/canceling an order. The entries are identified by package so that each package can have its own set of reasons. Sites may wish to modify the entries in this file to fit their needs. It is important to maintain the correct links to the Radiology Reason file if modifications are made. These links are maintained in the CODE field. For Radiology Reasons, the code field is the internal \# of the Radiology Reason file, followed by the characters RA. This file points to the Nature of Order file. This relationship is what identifies the appropriate actions to take for any DC reason. |
| 100.04  | ORDER CHECK OVERRIDE REASONS         | This file contains pre-defined override reasons that can be used when order checks are overridden. **Note:** Although an option to edit this file was not provided, there aren’t any known restrictions to sites adding override reasons. Sites that can add a new entry to ORDER CHECK OVERRIDE REASONS via FileMan may do to. However, the original list of override reasons should NOT be edited or deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Based on the notification IEN, data from this file is used to generate the notification and help determine its recipients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 100.98  | DISPLAY GROUP                        | This file allows orders to be clustered in groups other than by package. It is similar in structure to the OPTION File (19). This allows display groups to be arranged in a hierarchy. The main entry in this file should be ALL SERVICES. Other entries should be logically subordinate to the ALL SERVICES entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Database Integration Agreements

Database Integration Agreements (DBIA) are available on the DBA menu on MailMan.

Callable routines, entry points, Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) can be subscribed to. Lists of these will be available on the DBA menu on the Forum.

## CPRS Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)

A remote procedure call (RPC) is M code that can take optional parameters to do some task and then return either a single value or an array to the client application. In the message sent to VISTA, client applications will include the name of the requested RPC to be activated. These RPCs will be registered in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (\#8994) containing available and authorized RPCs.

**The following four “key” fields of the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (\#8994) must be populated**  
| Field Name                | Entry    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NAME (\#.01)              | Required | The name that identifies the RPC (this entry should be namespaced in the package namespace).                                                                                                                                    |
| TAG (\#.02)               | Required | The tag at which the remote procedure call begins.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ROUTINE (\#.03)           | Required | The name of the routine which should be invoked to start the RPC.                                                                                                                                                               |
| RETURN VALUE TYPE (\#.04) | Required | This indicates to the Broker how to format the return values. For example, if RETURN VALUE TYPE is WORD PROCESSING, then each entry in the returning list will have a \<CR\>\<LF\> (\<carriage return\>\<line feed\>) appended. |

### How to Register an RPC

Because of security concerns, all RPCs run via the RPC Broker and used internally by any VISTA package must be “registered” to each package application that uses those RPCs. The Broker on the server will check each RPC that it receives whether or not the RPC is registered to the application that the user is running on the client workstation. If the RPC has not been registered, the Broker will reject it and send an appropriate error message to the client. It is highly desirable to make RPCs as generic as possible so they can be utilized by as many packages as possible. Therefore, an individual RPC can be registered to and used by multiple packages.

To register an RPC to a package, the following procedures must be performed:

1\. Select the entry in the OPTION file (\#19) which corresponds to your client/server application.  
2\. Verify the client/server application TYPE field is a B type option.  
**☞ NOTE: The OPTION TYPE "B" represents a Broker client/server type option.**  
3 .In the RPC multiple for this option type, the following information is entered:  
| Field Name   | Entry    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RPC (\#.01)  | Required | This field is used to enter a pointer to the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (\#8994). This field links the remote procedure call in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (\#8994) to the package option. |
| RPCKEY (\#1) | Optional | field is used to restrict the use of a remote procedure call to a particular package option. The RPCKEY field is a free-text pointer to the SECURITY KEY file (\#19.1).              |
| RULES (\#2)  | Optional | This field is used to enter M code that is executed when an RPC request is made to verify whether the request should be honored.                                                     |  
4\. You provide access to the option of your client/server application the same way as any other in VISTA. You can even place it on the System Command Options menu [XUCOMMAND], if you want everyone to have it, however, don't forget to rebuild the menu trees!  
**☞ NOTE: RPC to package registration can be automated via the KIDS install of the package.**

## Glossary

**ASU** Authorization/Subscription Utility, a utility that allows sites to associate users with user classes, allowing them to specify the level of authorization needed to sign or order specific document types and orderables.  
**ACTION** A functional process that a clinician or clerk uses in the List Manager computer program. “Edit,” “Create,” and “Find” are examples of actions.  
**ACTIVATE** To make an inactive window active by clicking anywhere in it.  
**AICS** Automated Information Collection System, formerly Integrated Billing; software developed at Albany IRMFO, supported by MCCR, producing scannable Encounter Forms.  
**ALERTS** Brief online notices that are issued to users as they complete a cycle through the menu system. Alerts are designed to provide interactive notification of pending computing activities, such as the need to reorder supplies or review a patient's clinical test results. Along with the alert message is an indication that the View Alerts common option should be chosen to take further action.  
**APPLICATION**  
**COORDINATOR**  
**(ADPAC)** A person at a hospital or clinic assigned to coordinate the ADP activities in a specific department. This person is usually a specialist in his department (e.g., a medical technologist or a pharmacist) first and the applications coordinator second.  
**APPLICATION**  
**PROGRAMMING**  
**INTERFACE (API)** Programmer calls provided for use by application programmers. APIs allow programmers to carry out standard computing activities without needing to duplicate Kernel utilities in their own packages. APIs also further DBA goals of system integration by channeling activities, such as adding new users, through a limited number of callable entry points.  
**BOILERPLATE TEXT** A pre-defined Progress Notes or Discharge Summary template containing standard text, with blanks to fill in for specific data about a patient.  
**BOOT**  To load instructions into main memory to get a computer operational.  
**CIO FIELD OFFICE** Chief Information Office Field Office (formerly known as IRMFO: Information Resource Management Field Office (formerly ISC). **V***IST***A** has nine CIOFOs, each responsible for developing assigned application packages and for supporting the medical centers' VISNs within the IRMFO region.  
**CLIENT** A single term used interchangeably to refer to the user, the workstation, and the portion of the program that runs on the workstation. In an object-oriented environment, a client is a member of a group that uses the services of an unrelated group. If the client is on a local area network (LAN), it can share resources with another computer (server).  
**CLIENT-SERVER**  
**ARCHITECTURE** A Network consisting of a workstation (client) and a central computer holding the database, linked by TCP/IP.  
**CLINICIAN** A doctor or other provider in the medical center who is authorized to provide patient care.  
**COMPONENT** In Progress Notes, Components are "sections" or "pieces" of documents, such as Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan in a SOAP Progress Components may have (sub)Components as items. They may have Boilerplate Text. Components may be designated SHARED.  
**CONSULTS** A component or package of the CPRS (it can function as part of CPRS, independently as a standalone package, or as part of TIU). Consults are referrals of patients by the primary care physician to another hospital service/specialty, to obtain a medical opinion based on patient evaluation and completion of any procedures, modalities, or treatments the consulting specialist deems necessary to render a medical opinion. For instance, if a primary care physician orders a patient evaluation from Cardiology Service, and the cardiology specialist orders an Electrocardiogram (EKG) to complete the evaluation and provide an opinion concerning the patient’s condition, this type of order is considered a “Consult.”  
**CONTROL** An object in a window on the screen which the user can cause action with visible results or change settings to modify a future action.  
**COTS** Commercial Off the Shelf ; products not developed by **V***IST***A**.  
**COVER SHEET** A screen of the CPRS patient chart which displays an overview of the patient’s record, with tabs at the bottom representing components of a patient’s chart.  
**CWAD** Crises, Warnings, Allergies/Adverse Reactions, and Advance Directives.  
**DISCHARGE SUMMARY** A discharge summary is a formal synopsis of a patient’s medical care during a single hospitalization. It includes the pertinent diagnostic and therapeutic tests and procedures as well as the conclusions generated by those tests. A discharge summary is prepared for all discharges and transfers from a VA medical center or domiciliary or from nursing home care. The automated Discharge Summary module provides an efficient and immediate mechanism for clinicians to capture transcribed patient discharge summaries online, where they’re available for review, signing, adding addendum, etc.  
**DLL** Dynamic Link Library. A DLL allows executable routines to be stored separately as files with a DLL extension. These routines are only loaded when a program calls for them. DLLs provide several advantages:  
1\. DLLs help save on computer memory, since memory is only consumed when a DLL is loaded.  
2\. DLLs ease maintenance tasks. Because the DLL is a separate file, any modifications made to the DLL will not affect the operation of the calling program or any other DLL.  
3\. DLLs help avoid redundant routines. They provide generic functions that can be utilized by a variety of programs.  
**EVENTS** An object-oriented term that represents user actions that a GUI application interface recognizes, such as a mouse click or pressing the down arrow key.  
**GUI** Graphical User Interface. A type of display format that enables users to choose commands, initiate programs, and other options by selecting pictorial representations (icons) via a mouse or a keyboard.  
**HEALTH SUMMARY** A **V***IST***A** product which can be viewed through CPRS. It includes snapshots of part or all of a patient’s tests and results (based on how the site has it set up).  
**HL-7** Hospital Level 7, communications standards/protocols to link different computer systems together.  
**ICON** A picture or symbol that graphically represents an object or a concept.  
**IDCU** The Integrated Data Communications Utility which is a wide area network used by VA for transmitting data between VA sites.  
**IMAGING** A component of the patient chart; includes Radiology, X-rays, Nuclear Medicine, etc.  
**IRMS** Information Resource Management Service. A service at VA medical centers responsible for computer management and system security.  
**KERNEL DATA BROKER** See RPC Broker.  
**MODAL** A state or "mode" in which the user can only act or respond to a single dialogue box or window. You must select a response before you can exit or do anything else in the program.  
**MODELESS** The user is free to select and act in any window.  
**NAMESPACING** A convention for naming **V***IST***A** package elements. The Database Administrator (DBA) assigns unique character strings for package developers to use in naming routines, options, and other package elements so that packages may coexist. The DBA also assigns a separate range of file numbers to each package.  
**NOTIFICATIONS** Alerts regarding specific patients that appear on the CPRS patient chart.  
**OCIO** Office of the Chief Information Officer, located in Washington, D.C. All CIO Field Offices ultimately report to this entity, which is subordinate to the Office of the Undersecretary for Health.  
**OBJECT-BASED**  
**PROGRAMMING** Involves the use of components.  
**OBJECT-ORIENTED**  
**PROGRAMMING** Involves the creation of components. These components are self-contained collections of data structures and routines that interact with other components or objects.  
**OE/RR** Order Entry/Results Reporting; a package developed to interface with all **V***IST***A** packages, now part of CPRS.  
**PATIENT POSTINGS** A component of the patient chart; includes messages about patient; an expanded version of CWAD (see above).  
**PCE** Patient Care Encounter; a **V***IST***A** program that’s part of the Ambulatory Data Capture Project (ADCP), and also provides Clinical Reminders, which appear on Health Summaries.  
**PCMM** Patient Care Management Module, a **V***IST***A** product that manages patient/provider lists.  
**PDMP** Prescription Drug-Monitoring Program. CPRS provides capabilities for ad-hoc PDMP queries for retrieving the data and automatic generation of a progress note for the medical record.  
**PROGRESS NOTES** The Progress Notes module of TIU is used by health care givers to enter and sign online patient progress notes and by transcriptionists to enter notes to be signed by caregivers at a later date. Caregivers may review progress notes online or print progress notes in chart format for filing in the patient’s record.  
**REMOTE PROCEDURE**  
**CALL** A remote procedure call (RPC) is essentially some M code that may take optional parameters to do some work and then return either a single value or an array back to the client application.  
**RESOURCE** In **V***IST***A**, a method that enables sequential processing of tasks. The processing is accomplished with a RES device type designed by the application programmer and implemented by IRM. The process is controlled via the RESOURCE file (\#3.54).  
**RPC BROKER** The RPC Broker acts as a bridge connecting the client application front-end on the workstation (e.g., Delphi GUI applications) to the M-based data and business rules on the server. It serves as the communications medium for messaging between VISTA client/server applications.  
**RUBBER BAND JUMP** In roll and scroll mode of **V***IST***A**, a menu jump used to go out to an option and then return, in a bouncing motion. The syntax of the jump is two up-arrows followed by an option's menu text or synonym (e.g., \^\^Print Option File). If the two up-arrows are not followed by an option specification, the user is returned to the primary menu (see Go-home Jump).  
**SEMI-MODAL** A window or dialogue box that will yield focus to the parent window for some limited processing. Typically, semi-modal dialogue boxes remain in the foreground even after yielding focus.  
**SERVER** The computer where the data and the Business Rules reside. It makes resources available to client workstations on the network. In **V***IST***A** , it is an entry in the OPTION file (\#19). An automated mail protocol that is activated by sending a message to a server at another location with the "S.server" syntax. A server's activity is specified in the OPTION file (\#19) and can be the running of a routine or the placement of data into a file.  
**TIU** Text Integration Utilities, a **V***IST***A** application interfacing with CPRS that manages document-oriented modules such as Progress Notes, Discharge Summary, and Consults.  
**USABILITY** The ease and comfort a program provides to people. Programs that are user-centered rather than machine or programmer-centered.  
**USER CLASS** The basic component of ASU (Authorization/ Subscription Utility). The User Class file contains the different categories of users within a hospital. ASU allows sites to designate who is authorized to do what.  
**USER-CENTERED** A program designed to match the way people do things  
**USER INTERFACE** The way the package is presented to the user, such as Graphical User Interfaces that display option prompts, help messages, and menu choices, the List Manager User Interface (described at the beginning of this manual), and the roll and scroll interface, the traditional **V***IST***A** terminal-based user interface.  
**VHA** Veterans Health Administration  
**VISN** Veterans Integrated Service Networks, geographic groupings of VA Medical Centers which together share resources and collaborate to maximize use of resources and efficiently meet the needs of veterans in their service areas.  
**V***IST***A** VHA Information Systems & Technology Architecture, formerly DHCP (Decentralized Hospital Computer Program), the VA's comprehensive, integrated, medical center computer system. It consists of hardware, software packages, and comprehensive support for system-wide and station-specific, clinical and administrative automation needs.  
**WINDOW** An object on the screen that presents information such as a document or message.  
## Troubleshooting & Helpful Hints

Here are a few hints and troubleshooting items to help those supporting CPRS.

### CPRS Use of HL7

-   Standard HL7 protocol is used, but not VA HL7 package.  
-   Package protocol links facilitate HL7 communications.  
-   HL7 messaging updates ancillary packages from CPRS and vice versa.  
-   If protocols are unlinked, status updates between packages will fail.  
-   HL7 is also used to update package orderables.  
### Protocol Linkage

Each interfacing package has protocols that communicate with OE/RR. Order Communications via Protocols/HL7:

-   User places an order.  
-   Order sent by CPRS to the receiving package.  
-   The receiving package processes the order.  
-   The receiving package sends a message to CPRS.  
### Multiple Sign-On

Clinical staff may want to have both GUI CPRS and *VIST*A terminal sessions open.

-   Single sign-on is available with Broker 1.1.  
-   PC must have broker client agent running.  
-   User enters Access/Verify only once for *VIST*A logon (via GUI or roll-and-scroll).  
-   It only works for Telnet-based roll and scroll sessions.  
-   Parameters control availability at system and user levels.  
### Resource Devices

CPRS adds the following resource devices:

-   OR MOVEMENT RESOURCE  
-   ORB NOTIFICATION RESOURCE  
-   ORW THREAD RESOURCE  
-   ORW/PXAPI RESOURCE  
-   ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE  
#### New Graphing Resource Device

**Note:** In CPRS v.29, caching for graphing is disabled.  
CPRS v.27 has improved performance on graphing patient data by using a “cache”, or gathering the patient’s data in advance of using graphing functions. Gathering the data avoids always fetching the data. When caching is not used, the graphing functions extract data when items are selected.

Caching is only used under specific conditions, and is transparent to any actions by the user. Caching happens only when a user has previously graphed results on a specific patient. When Provider A is reviewing Patient Z for the first time, graphing will extract data only when items are selected. If Provider A selects Patient Z again and uses graphing, the following sequence happens:

1.  A job is started in the background, this job checks to see if the patient already has cached data. If the patient has cached data, then only recent data is extracted to update that cache. If not, then all data on the patient is extracted to create a new cache. This ensures that the cache has all data on the patient.  
1.  The cache is transferred to the CPRS application for use with graphing.  
1.  While the user is graphing data, the application is always checking to see if the cache has been transferred. The application uses cached data if it is available. Otherwise, it continues using the old method of extracting from selected items.  
In order to make sure that there is not excessive system processing of extracting data, a new resource device (ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE) is included in CPRS v27. It is initially set to only allow 3 processes to be running at one time. The Resource Slots field can be changed to allow more or less processes to occur.

NAME: ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE \$I: ORWG GRAPHING RESOURCE  
LOCATION OF TERMINAL: CPRS GUI graphing data retrieval  
RESOURCE SLOTS: 3 SUBTYPE: P-OTHER  
TYPE: RESOURCES  
#### Clearing a Resource Device

Errors can cause resources to “plug.” You should monitor resources using TaskMan. KERNEL tools “unplug” resources as shown in the example below.

Select Device Management Option: **CLEAR ONE\<Enter\>**Resource  
Select RESOURCE NAME: **HLCS RESO\<Enter\>**URCE  
Select SLOTS IN USE SLOT IN USE: **?\< \<Enter\>**1  
2  
3  
Select SLOTS IN USE SLOT IN USE: **1\<Enter\>**  
### Use of KERNEL HFS Files

-   CPRS uses host file capabilities to display V*IST*A reports in ListMan and GUI.  
-   HFS files require ZIS-related KERNEL patches (especially OpenM sites!).  
-   Ensure KERNEL parameter DEFAULT DIRECTORY FOR HFS is set appropriately.  
-   Ensure directory has read, write, and delete privileges enabled.  
### Time-Delay Order Issues

-   Time delay orders for admission, transfer, or discharge are available.  
-   Time delay admission and transfer orders are based on treating specialty.  
-   If MAS Movement is entered with different specialty, orders will NOT release!  
-   Option exists to release or cancel time delay orders.  
-   Discharge medications release to pharmacy immediately.  
### Provider Selection List Missing Names

During CPRS GUI v27 testing, a test site identified a problem with the AUSER cross reference affecting the provider selection list, e.g., providers that should have been on the list were not included. The site re-indexed the AUSER cross reference on the NEW PERSON file (\#200), and the problem was resolved.

If a site notices that providers that should be on the list are not there, the site should enter a Remedy ticket and may want to re-index the AUSER cross reference. Sites should consider the side effects of re-indexing before re-indexing AUSER. The AUSER cross reference may be re-indexed using VA FileMan. Sites may want to re-index during off hours to minimize impacts. If someone is using the cross reference during the re-index, names on the list will disappear and may reappear as a partial list.

### GUI Debugging Tools

The main debugging tools that are built into the CPRS executable itself are:

1.  **DEBUG command line parameter**—This uses the broker Debug property. If the keyword DEBUG is on the CPRS executable command line, it sets the debug property to true. This allows Customer Support to step through M code without accessing Delphi source code.  
1.  **Last Broker Call**—CPRS has a wrapper around the broker component. This is mostly so it can treat broker calls as functions and procedures that accept a variable number of parameters of any type. The call allows you to use strong typing on the Delphi side while eliminating the tedium of constant type conversions when calling the broker. This wrapper also logs broker calls, so that the user can step back and see the data that was exchanged in each call. The “wrapper” is part of CPRS, in the ORNet.pas unit. For this to appear on the Help menu in the CPRS GUI, the user must have the XUPROGMODE key.  
1.  **Show ListBox Data**—CPRS uses its own custom controls extensively. These controls allow you to store strings of information along with listbox items. This call will show the data “hidden” behind each listbox item.  
These are the main things we use when debugging from within the CPRS executable itself. When debugging from the Delphi environment, where there is access to the source, we use the regular Delphi debugger. Sometimes we use some additional debugging tricks when debugging from the source code— like setting up timers to continuously display state information (a poor man’s ZWATCH) or calls to the Windows function “OutputDebugString” (a poor man’s ZWRITE).

###

### Configuring the Client HOSTS File

The workstation can be configured in such a way that the client HOSTS file is not used for RPC Broker connections or other TELNET connections. Set up the WinNT or Win95/98 client as follows:

1.  Right-click Network Neighborhood and select Properties.  
1.  Select the Protocols tab.  
1.  Highlight the Network Protocol: TCP/IP Protocol.  
1.  Select Properties.  
1.  Select the DNS tab.  
1.  In the Domain box enter the local Bind Server Domain Name, i.e. SiteName.MED.VA.GOV  
1.  In the DNS Service Search Order box, add the Bind Server numeric address as the top entry.  
1.  Remove any existing entries and add entries in the DNS search order appropriate for your site as stated in FORUM message Subj: VA Intranet Gateway Status [\#25087701].  
1.  Click Apply.  
1.  Click OK.  
1.  Shutdown & Re-Start the client workstation.  
1.  Connect to VISTA via the terminal emulator you choose.  
Most terminal emulators can be configured (with a macro) so that the Username prompt is stuffed with the appropriate Username and the end-user only sees the Access/Verify code prompt.

### OE/RR Error File

#### ORERR Routine ⎯ Purpose

1\. Log errors in the data stream without generating hard errors that would cause Users to be thrown off the system.  
2\. Puts the runtime information into a FileMan compatible file that support people can search with FileMan tools.  
DO \^ORERR(ORTYP,ORMSG,ORVAR)  
***

**Where…**  
ORTYP is copied verbatim into the ‘ERROR TYPE’ field.  
ORMSG either names the HL7 message array or is the HL7 message array  
ORVAR is an array that has as its subscripts the names of local variables that are to be saved in the error record. If the local variable named happens to be an array then the entire local array is saved.  
**Example 1:** ORM+5 🡪 I '\$O(@ORMSG@(0)) D \^ORERR("Missing HL7 message",.ORMSG) Q  
**Example 2:** ORM+7 🡪 I 'MSH D \^ORERR("Missing or invalid MSH segment",.ORMSG) Q  
***

**Example 3:** ORM+9 🡪 I '\$L(ORNMSP) D \^ORERR("Missing or invalid sending application",.ORMSG) Q  
***

**Example 4:** ORM+10 🡪 D PID I '\$G(ORVP) D \^ORERR("Missing or invalid patient ID",.ORMSG) Q  
***

**Example 5:** EN1+10\^ORM. 🡪 S ORTN="EN\^ORM"_ORNMSP D @ORTN  
*(ORTN in this example is equal to ‘ORMRA’)*  
***

EN+1\^ORMRA 🡪 I '\$L(\$T(@ORDCNTRL)) S ORERR="Invalid order control code" Q  
*(OOPS… ORDCNTRL has an invalid value so back to \^ORM)*  
***

EN1+11\^ORM 🡪 D:\$D(ORERR) ERROR K \^TMP("ORWORD",\$J)  
*(Error detected… Do error subroutine)*  
***

ERROR+2\^ORM 🡪 N ORV S ORV("XQY0")="" D \^ORERR(ORERR,.ORMSG,.ORV)

### Notifications Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem:** Why is a user not receiving a notification for CPRSPATIENT,ONE?  
**Solution:** Follow the notification trouble-shooting flowchart below:  
Is the Notification System Enabled?  
Yes No [Enable it using option Enable or Disable Notification System]  
***

Is TaskMan blocked by the ORB NOTIFICATION RESOURCE entry in the RESOURCE file?  
Yes [Use option Clear one Resource to release it. No  
Or delete all slots in use for the resource.]  
***

Determine provider recipients using option Set Provider Recipients for Notifications  
Is the Provider Recipients parameter set up correctly for the notification?  
Yes No [Set proper values.]  
***

Review the output from option Display the Notifications a User Can Receive  
Is the notification in question ON (Enabled)?  
Yes No [Enable it.]  
***

Determine the patient’s alerts using option Display Patient Alerts and Alert Recipients  
Look for the alert and display recipients for the related alert.  
Did the user appear on the list of recipients?  
Yes [They did receive the alert or No [If the alert is order-related,  
the alert was reviewed and deleted note the order\# (in brackets) of the  
by another user before this user saw the order. Look in the patient’s chart for  
the alert. the order.]  
***

Review the list of recipients from the option Determine Recipients for a Notification  
Did the user appear on the list of recipients?  
Yes [Something may have changed No  
since the original notification was  
triggered. Check team list membership,  
patient’s providers or notification-related  
parameter values.]  
***

Examine Notification Algorithm Source table  
at the end of this guide and  
Notifications – How It Works document  
How is the notification processed?  
***

**Expert System Rule (MLM)** **M Code**  
1\. Examine the related rule. 1. Examine related M code.  
2\. Using FileMan, search in the ORDER CHECK RAW 2. Ask package developer for assistance.  
DATA LOG file for entries that trigger the rule.  
[e.g. SOURCE equals \<DATA SOURCE from source table\>  
PATIENT contains CPRSPATIENT,ONE  
TIMESTAMP contains 19971106.]  
3\. Review related entries in ORDER CHECK COMPILER FUNCTIONS.  
***

**Problem:** The follow-up action for a notification is not working.  
**Solution:** Follow the steps below:  
1\. Obtain an instance of the alert in question. You may want to ask a recipient of the alert to forward the alert to you via the View Alerts action.  
2\. Search in the Kernel Alert file for the entry corresponding to the alert.  
a. D \^%G  
b. \^XTV(8992,\<DUZ\>,”XQA”,\<date alert was triggered in FM format – e.g. 2971106:2971107\>  
You should get strings that look something like this:  
\^XTV(8992,13,"XQA",2971105.115326,0) =  
2971105.115326\^OR,66,50;1311;2971105.115326\^  
CPRSPATIE (C0005): New order(s) placed.\^\^R\^\^NEWORD\^ ORB3FUP1\^\^\^\^\^1\^1  
\^XTV(8992,13,"XQA",2971105.115326,1) = @OR\|164V@PS  
In the 0 node, the important pieces are:  
**2**: XQAID\^OR,\<dfn\>,\<100.9 ien\>;\<triggering duz\>;\<alert fm d/t\>  
**3**: alert message  
**7**: tag for follow-up action  
**8**: routine for follow-up action  
**13**: days before forwarding alert to user’s mailman surrogate\*  
**14**: days before forwarding alert to user’s service/section chief (supervisor)\*  
\* forwarding alerts to surrogates/supervisors triggered via option XQALERT DELETE OLD  
The 1 node contains data which may or may not be used in the follow-up action.  
3\. Check the follow-up M code and data used to see if the follow-up action occurs properly.  
**Problem:** I cannot figure out what providers are linked to a patient via Teams.  
**Solution:** D TPTPR\^ORQPTQ1(.ORY,\<dfn\>) ZW ORY This will list all providers linked to the patient via Teams. [Hint: Look at the routine ORQPTQ1 for other entry points related to team lists and patient data.]  
**Problem:** After an alert is processed, it goes away. Where does it go?  
**Solution:** Kernel stores alerts that have been processed or deleted in the Alert Tracking file [\^XTV(8992.1]. You can use FileMan to search or inquire regarding entries in this file. For a FileMan inquire you can enter the user’s name, patient’s name or FileMan date/time to obtain results.  
**Problem:** The user had an alert but now it is gone and they did nothing to cause the alert to go away.  
**Solution:** To clean up old alerts, sites should run the Kernel option XQALERT DELETE OLD on a daily basis. If the alert is older than the allotted number of days in the Kernel option, the alert would have been deleted. If the alert does not meet the criteria for Kernel option deletion, another user may have performed the action necessary to delete the alert. Check the parameter value for the alert to determine if it should be deleted for all recipients when one recipient performs the follow-up action or reviews the alert. This value is usually not changed by the site so review the value in the Notification Exported Default Values doc or after running FileMan in programmer mode check the value for OERR via the parameter editor.  
D \^XPAREDIT  
Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: ORB DELETE MECHANISM  
Enter selection: 3 (Package [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]  
**Problem:** A user wants you to delete one or more alerts.  
**Solution:** Give yourself the XQAL-DELETE key. Run the option XQALERT BY USER DELETE. You’ll get a list of pending alerts for the user. Select those you wish to delete.  
**Problem:** I’m not getting notifications for some lab results.  
**Solution:** Some lab tests are not meant to be resulted. This is indicated in the Lab test file (\#60) and the Orderable Items file (\#101.43). In both files there is a field called TYPE. The field in both files is a set of codes which indicates if the lab test is to be resulted or not. The codes consist of I:Input, O:Output, B:Both and N:Neither. If the TYPE for a lab test in the Lab file or Orderable Item file is set to “I” or “N,” results will not be sent by lab. This may sometimes be set incorrectly and should be looked at when troubleshooting lab results-related notifications/alerts such as Lab Results, Abnormal Lab Results, Critical Lab Results, and STAT Results Available. If a lab results-related notification is not firing for a particular lab test, check the TYPE field for that test in the Lab Test and Orderable Items files. If it is “I” or “N” in either file, the results will not be posted via HL7 and the alert will not be sent.  
**Problem:** None of our users are getting several notifications they should be getting. Are there any other reasons besides those listed above?  
**Solution:** Check ORMTIME. ORMTIME is automatically scheduled once the Orders conversion is done. The following notifications/alerts are triggered via ORMTIME. If ORMTIME is not running/queued, they will not be sent.  
-   DNR Expiring  
-   Medications Expiring – Inpt  
-   Medications Expiring – Outpt  
-   NPO Diet \> 72 Hours  
-   Unverified Medication Order  
-   Unverified Order  
#### Notification Recipient Determination

The OE/RR Notifications utility determines recipients of a patient’s particular notification/alert in the following order:

1\. Check the value of the parameter ORB SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE. If it is ‘D’isabled, do not process or send any notifications. If it is ‘E’nabled, process notifications as outlined below.  
2\. Get the default/regular recipients for this notification regardless of patient from the parameter ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS. Accessed via the Option ORB3 DEFAULT RECIPIENTS, teams or individuals can be set up to automatically always get a notification. If a team is identified, every user on that team (regardless of other parameter, option settings), will receive the notification/alert. Good uses of this parameter include troubleshooting notifications and delivering the Food/Drug Interaction notification [for all patients] to a team of dietitians.  
3\. Obtain the default/regular device recipients for this notification regardless of patient from the parameter ORB DEFAULT DEVICE RECIPIENTS. Accessed via the Option ORB3 DEFAULT DEVICE RECIPIENTS, one or more devices can be set up to automatically always get a notification. The device may be a printer, file or any other device defined at the site. This is useful if every instance of an alert across all patients is desired for QA, JCAHO or research purposes.  
4\. Additional potential recipients are obtained from:  
a. A recipient list identified by the service triggering the alert. For example, Radiology sends OE/RR Notifications a list of potential recipients when its STAT Imaging Request notification is triggered.  
b. Provider-related recipients indicated in the parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. Accessed via the Option ORB3 PROVIDER RECIPIENTS, the Primary provider, Attending physician, patient care Teams, or Ordering/requesting provider can be set to receive a notification. If set for Teams, all teams to which the patient belongs will be evaluated to obtained potential recipients. If set for Orderer and an order number is passed by the service triggering the alert, the ordering/requesting provider will be determined and added to the potential list. In addition, if the Orderer does not have signature authority (does not hold the ORES key) and the notification either Order Requires Electronic Signature or Order Requires Co-signature, the teams to which the Orderer belongs will be evaluated and every user on those teams (which also include the patient), will be added to the potential recipient list.  
5\. Each user on the potential recipient list is evaluated according to values set for entities identified in the parameter ORB PROCESSING FLAG. These entity values are accessed via the Option ORB3 PROCESSING FLAG also called Enable/Disable Notifications. These entity values are processed in the following order to determine if that particular user should receive the notification/alert or not. *The first condition met stops the processing and determines whether or not the user will receive the notification*. Processing order:  
a. If the USER’s value for the notification is set to Mandatory or Enabled, the user will receive the notification.  
b. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is set to Mandatory, the user will receive the notification.  
c. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is set to Mandatory, the user will receive the notification.  
d. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is set to Mandatory, the user will receive the notification.  
e. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is set to Disabled, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
f. If the user’s DIVISION value for the notification is set to Mandatory, the user will receive the notification.  
g. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is set to Mandatory and DIVISION has no value, the user will receive the notification.  
h. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is set to Mandatory and SYSTEM and DIVISION have no value, the user will receive the notification.  
i. If the USER’s value for the notification is set to Disabled, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
j. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is set to Disabled, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
k. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is set to Disabled, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
l. If the user’s DIVISION value for the notification is set to Disabled, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
m. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is set to Disabled and DIVISION has no value, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
n. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is set to Disabled and SYSTEM and DIVISION have no value, the user will NOT receive the notification.  
o. If none of the above parameter values are found, the notification is processed as Disabled and the user will NOT receive the notification.

### Order Checking Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem:** Not getting order checks  
**Trouble-shooting Flowchart**  
Is the OC System Enabled?  
Yes No [Enable it.]  
***  
Display OCs User Can Receive  
Is the OC in question ON (Enabled?)  
Yes No [Enable it.]  
***  
Examine OC Log File for Related Entries  
Is message logging enabled?  
Yes No [Enable it. You must wait until  
after an order check has been  
triggered again to log an entry.]  
***  
D \^%G  
\^XTMP(“ORKLOG”,\<date range\>,\<patient id\>  
e.g. (\^XTMP(“ORKLOG”,2971106:2971107,16)  
Is there a related order check?  
Yes [If an entry matches that patient, No  
oc and user, then for some reason,  
OERR did not display the message.]  
***  
Examine OC Algorithm Source  
How is the OC processed?  
Expert System Rule (MLM) M Code  
1\. Examine the related rule. 1. Determine main routine for OC’s mode.  
2\. Search the ORDER CHECK RAW 2. Examine related M code.  
DATA LOG file for entries that 3. Re-examine \^XTMP(“ORKLOG” for  
trigger the rule: SOURCE equals OEPS entries/data used in the M code.  
PATIENT contains CPRSPATIENT,ONE 4. Test by plugging data from \^XTMP  
TIMESTAMP contains 19971106. log file into M code.  
3\. Review related entries in ORDER CHECK  
COMPILER FUNCTIONS.  
4\. Check linkages used in OC Term Lookup.  
**Problem:** Not getting expected order checks.  
**Possible Reasons:**  
1\. Orderer does not select a dispense drug when ordering a medication. Critical drug interactions, duplicate drug and duplicate drug class order checks will not occur.  
2\. Orderer places an order for an IV solution. Duplicate drug order check will not occur.  
3\. During recompilation of the CPRS Expert System rules, expert system-based order checks will not occur.  
4\. If the CPRS Expert System encounters an error, expert system-based order checks will not occur.  
5\. Ordered medication does not have a corresponding entry (pointer) in the Nat’l Drug File. Drug-allergy interaction order check will not occur.  
6\. Ordered lab procedure does not have an entry in the Lab file [\#60] MAX. ORDER FREQ. field (under the COLLECTION SAMPLE multiple). The Maximum Order Frequency portion of the Lab Order Freq Restrictions order check will not occur.  
7\. Ordered lab procedure does not have an entry in the Lab file [\#60] SINGLE DAY MAX ORDER FREQ field (under the COLLECTION SAMPLE multiple). The Single Day Maximum Order Frequency portion of the Lab Order Freq Restrictions order check will not occur.  
8\. Ordered lab procedure has entries in the Lab file [\#60] for both MAX. ORDER FREQ. and SINGLE DAY MAX ORDER FREQ fields (under the COLLECTION SAMPLE multiple). The Single Day Maximum Order Frequency portion of the Lab Order Freq Restrictions order check will not occur.  
9\. Local terms at site not linked (or linked incorrectly) to Nat’l CPRS Expert System terms. See instructions.

#### Order Checking and OE/RR Dialogs

##### Mechanism

1\. OE/RR calls EN\^ORKCHK at the trigger events.  
a. Routines which call EN\^ORKCHK: ORCDLG, ORCDPS, ORCMENU1  
b. Events:  
• Ordering dialog/display  
• Orderable item selection  
• Order acceptance  
• Ordering session completion  
• Special events:  
− Delayed/time-release orders initiated  
− Orders Renewed or Edited  
− Orders signed in a later session (delayed signature)  
2\. EN\^ORKCHK Parameters:  
a. Array of return messages in format: order number\^order check ien[\#100.8]\^clinical danger level\^message  
• return array will be sorted by clinical danger level, order number, then sequence processed  
• clinical danger levels are expressed as integers: 1 = High, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Low  
• DISPLAY mode order checks return a clinical danger level of “’ (null)  
b. Patient dfn  
c. Array of ordering information in format: orderable item ien\|filler application (PS, RA, FH, LR, etc.)\|nat’l id\^nat’l text\^nat’l coding system\^local id\^local text\^local coding system\|order effective date/time\|order number\|filler-specific data  
Filler -specific data:  
LR: specimen of the lab test ordered in the format: ien of  
Topography (specimen) file [\^LAB(61,]  
PS: medications ordered during this session in the format:  
med1\^med2\^med3\^…  
d. Mode/event trigger (DISPLAY,SELECT,ACCEPT,SESSION,NOTIF,ALL)  
3\. Event Examples (this example covers the List Manager interface; a similar process will occur in the GUI where the ORK TRIGGER remote procedure call will be invoked):  
a. DISPLAY example:  
S OCINFO(1)=”\|PS\|\|\|\|”  
S OCINFO=1  
D EN\^ORKCHK(.RTN,1234,.OCINFO,”DISPLAY”)  
b. SELECT example:  
S OCINFO(1)=”1385\|PS\|576.4\^DIGOXIN 0.5MG TAB\^99NDF\^4213\^DIGOXIN 0.5MG TAB\^99PSD\|\|\|”

S OCINFO=1  
D EN\^ORKCHK(.RTN,1234,.OCINFO,”ALL”)  
4\. For each member of the order information array:  
a. Initiate non-MLM order checks designated as appropriate for that mode/event trigger  
b. Initiate MLM order checks designated as appropriate for that mode/event trigger (each MLM created for order checking will have a mode/event trigger data element indicating when the MLM is to be processed)  
Order Checks Categorized by Event:

1\. Ordering dialog/display - including  
• Estimated creatinine clearance, for patients \<50 [MLM]  
• Order checking not available/supported  
• Renal functions for patients over 65 [MLM]  
• Polypharmacy [MLM]  
2\. Orderable item selection  
• Duplicate drug orders (against existing meds)  
• Duplicate drug class orders (against existing meds)  
• Critical drug interactions (against existing meds)  
• Clozapine appropriateness [MLM]  
• Allergy-contrast media interactions [MLM]  
• Physical limitations for CT and MRI scanners [MLM]  
• Biochem abnormality for contrast media [MLM]  
• Glucophage-contrast media interaction [MLM]  
• Dispense drug not selected  
• Recent barium study [MLM]  
3\. Order acceptance (includes checks where time is a factor in reducing false positives)  
• Duplicate orders (non-med)  
• Allergy-drug interactions  
• Recent oral cholecystogram [MLM]  
• Lab order frequency restrictions  
4\. Ordering session completion  
• Aminoglycosides [MLM]  
• Labs req’d with radiology orders [MLM]  
• Duplicate drug orders (against meds placed in same session)  
• Duplicate drug class orders (against meds placed in same session)  
• Critical drug interactions (against meds placed in same session)  
Order Checking Dialog and Override Mechanism:

1\. List of Order Check messages presented to user sorted by clinical danger level  
2\. Based on the Order Check’s clinical danger level and user’s OE/RR 2.5 elec signature key:  
a. User holds OREMAS key:  
• Process without prompting for justification but allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’ the order.  
b. User does not hold OREMAS key and clinical danger level is ‘2’ (Moderate) or ‘3’ (Low):  
• Process without prompting for justification but allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’ the order.  
c. User does not hold OREMAS key and clinical danger level is ‘1’ (High):  
• Prompt for justification by prompting to ‘Cancel’ or ‘Override’. If select ‘Override’, prompt for justification (allow selection from a list or to enter free text). If a justification is entered, allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’.  
3\. Order check messages and any accompanying over-ride justifications are sent with the order to the filling package and are displayed in the order’s detailed display. If the clinical danger level for an order check message is “High” (value of ‘1’), the order check message and justification are stored in the Order file [\#100] under the ‘9’ node.  
### FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

These frequently-asked questions are based on questions received from CPRS test sites.  
**Q.** What is the relationship between OE/RR and CPRS? I sometimes hear references to OE/RR 3.0 and much of the CPRS package just seems to be an enhanced OE/RR 2.5.  
**A.** This distinction does get fuzzy at times. CPRS is the umbrella package for a much more comprehensive suite of software. OE/RR 3.0 is a component of CPRS, and can’t be used outside of CPRS. Many of the packages contained within CPRS still have independent lives, for use by their services for administrative and other purposes, and occasionally to add and review orders (known as “backdoor” ordering). The CPRS documentation set mainly documents the OE/RR portion of CPRS (files and routines in the OR, OEX, and XPAR namespaces).  
**Q.** How do sites handle document verification (nurse and clerk)? Do they still print 24-hour summaries, chart copies, etc. for nurses and clerks to initial? How would they know, otherwise, what’s been done?  
**A.** West Palm Beach requires online verification. Nurses do the majority of the verification, and they do this online, periodically throughout the day, at designated workstations on the wards or clinics. Some copies are printed and put in the chart for contingencies and backup, but basically, it is a paperless system.  
**Q.** What are the benefits of a GUI over the traditional **V***IST***A** programs or the List Manager version of CPRS?  
**A.** A Windows-type environment (GUI) allows you to do many things easier and more efficiently. The visibility and accessibility of many components of a patient record allow you to move among them more freely to review and link data. You can choose your own workflow rather than having it dictated by the computer in a sequential way. Sometimes, the traditional roll-and-scroll and List Manager have advantages. For straightforward data entry, these methods can be faster and less complex.  
**Q.** When I write an order for digoxin and quinidine at the same time, the order check does not seem to take place until after it would with an order check between a new med and an old one. Did I understand that correctly?  
**A.** Your observations are correct regarding the order checking against new meds vs. old meds. Almost all medication-related order checks are performed by querying the pharmacy package. During the ordering process, pharmacy doesn't know about the meds placed during the ordering session. Meds are not "released" to the pharmacy service until they have been signed so checks between meds placed in the session cannot occur. Checks against meds already released to Pharmacy occur within the ordering process. Being unable to check against meds placed in a session was not acceptable so we devised a method where at the end of the ordering session all meds placed during the session are passed to the pharmacy package and they perform the med vs. med checks as if the patient were already receiving them. We waited until after the session is completed (just before electronic signature), because order checks are fairly resource-intensive and this approach minimizes the delays between prompts.  
**Q.** You used to be able to get a readout for lab alerts. Now, I get "abn: ldl 160" and that's it, not the whole lipid profile. Plus, you can't get into the lab/note file without re-entering the patient name.  
**A**. The way lab results (abnormal/critical) are displayed in the View Alerts list has been changed. In the old version, they required you to select the alert (a follow-up action) which displayed the abnormal/critical results along with other results associated with that lab order. In CPRS, each abnormal/critical lab result has its own alert, including abbreviated lab test name and result value but without the follow-up display of other associated results. There were many requests for this change from OE/RR 2.5 users. We hope you can get used to it and in the end find it to be better.  
You can set yourself up to get a Lab Results alert that will display all lab results for a lab order. This alert is not given to everyone because it triggers with every lab result and can be a great annoyance. In CPRS, you have more flexibility to turn notifications on or off and at different levels⎯site, division, service, or by user).  
**Q:** Why don’t I get notifications for some lab results?  
**A:** Some lab tests are not meant to be resulted. This is indicated in the Lab test file (\#60) and the Orderable Items file (\#101.43). In both files there is a field called TYPE. The field in both files is a set of codes which indicates if the lab test is to be resulted or not. The codes consist of I:Input, O:Output, B:Both and N:Neither. If the TYPE for a lab test in the Lab file or Orderable Item file is set to “I” or “N,” results will not be sent by lab. This may sometimes be set incorrectly and should be looked at when troubleshooting lab results-related notifications/alerts such as Lab Results, Abnormal Lab Results, Critical Lab Results, and STAT Results Available. If a lab results-related notification is not firing for a particular lab test, check the TYPE field for that test in the Lab Test and Orderable Items files. If it is “I” or “N” in either file, the results will not be posted via HL7 and the alert will not be sent.

### Notes on Notifications and Order Checks

**☞ NOTE:** **All alerts and order checks are a nuisance to some and a benefit to others. That is why they were designed with the flexibility to enable or disable them at many different levels.**  
**☞ NOTE:  Try disabling the objectionable order checks at the patient location level. The check will not be displayed for patients in that location (inpatient only) unless the user specifically has the order check enabled.**  
**☞ NOTE:  Another approach would be to disable the order check for your site (VAMC level) then enable it for the locations or users where the check is desired. You can also screen (enable or disable) order checks based on the user's service/specialty.**  
**☞ NOTE:  For order checks, the order of precedence when determining if order check should be performed or not is USER -\> PT LOCATION -\> SERVICE -\> VAMC. The user’s level has priority over patient location which priority over the user's service/ specialty and so on. If a value does not exist for the user (they have not enabled or disabled the order check), the software looks up the chain for a value at the patient location level. The software looks up the chain until a value is found. If nothing exists for the VAMC, a value released with CPRS is used.**  
**☞ NOTE:  While notifications use a similar hierarchy for determining whether or not an alert should be sent, it is more complicated because a notification/alert can be set to “mandatory.” A value of “mandatory” overrides most other values for that notification/alert.**

## Appendix A: CPRS Package Security

CPRS security is maintained through security keys, menu assignment, and VA FileMan protection. The following keys, parameters, and settings determine who can enter or sign orders and who can enter Group Notes.

### Controlling Which Users Can Enter and Sign Medication Orders

Several items control who can enter or sign medication orders:

-   file entries  
-   keys  
-   identification numbers  
-   Order Entry (OR) signature keys  
-   CPRS parameters  
CPRS uses the following OR signature keys:

-   ORES  
-   ORELSE  
-   OREMAS  
**Warning: A user who holds NO keys can enter medication orders in CPRS.**

Sites can also control who can write medication orders using the following:

#### The provider key

The “authorized to write meds” entry in the NEW PERSON file (200).

To place outpatient controlled substance medication orders, a provider must have proper credentials such as a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) number for the individual provider, or a VA facility DEA number along with an individual identifier (commonly called a VA number).

To further control orders for outpatient controlled substances, sites have the ability to specify for which controlled substances pharmacy schedules a provider may write medication orders.

In addition, each provider must have a Personal Identification Verification (PIV) card or smart card to order outpatient controlled substances medications. Use of this card with ordering creates the ability to digitally sign the outpatient controlled substances orders.

Several parameters in CPRS help govern who can write medication orders and non-VA medication information:

-   ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING—This parameter disables all clinical ordering.  
-   OR OREMAS MED ORDERS—This parameter controls whether OREMAS key holders can act on medication orders.  
-   OR OREMAS NON-VA MED ORDERS—This parameter controls whether OREMAS holders can enter Non-VA medication information.  
In CPRS, only the following users MAY NOT place orders:

-   Users whose ordering capability was disabled by parameter “ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING”  
-   Users who hold more than one ordering signature key: OREMAS, ORELSE, ORES (multiple key conflict)  
**Warning:** A user who holds NO keys can enter medication orders in CPRS.

Other than the above users, regardless of what key users hold (no key, "provider", or OR\* key), they are all allowed to place orders. But users without an ORE key cannot sign and release orders; the medication orders would remain unreleased until signed by a valid provider.

For a no-key user, CPRS cannot tell whether the user is a medical clerk, a medical student, or an outpatient clerk. Medical students and outpatient clerks may need to enter medication orders that would be signed later by a provider.

Sites can control ordering by administrative staff and clerks in the following ways:

-   To prevent a clerk from entering medication orders, sites can assign the user the OREMAS key .  
-   To disable an individual user’s capability to enter any clinical order, sites can use the parameter “ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING.”  
### Order Entry Signature Keys

The following three keys determine who can sign orders in CPRS.

-   ORES  
-   ORELSE  
-   OREMAS  
Do not assign more than one of the ORES, ORELSE, or OREMAS keys per user.

#### ORES Key

-   Assigned to users authorized to write and sign orders  
-   Typically assigned to licensed physicians  
-   Allows holders to electronically sign orders; available to service immediately  
#### ORELSE Key

-   Assigned to users authorized to release physician’s orders  
-   Typically assigned to RNs or other advanced practice clinicians  
-   Releases orders to service for immediate action  
#### OREMAS Key

-   Assigned to users authorized to release patient orders as signed on chart  
-   Typically assigned to Ward Clerks  
-   Releases orders to service for immediate action  
##### Allocating Signature Keys

Below is one way to assign Signature keys using the Clinical Coordinator menu. Remember that this should be done when creating or editing a user.

You must have Clinical Coordinator access to assign keys.

1.  In the appropriate account, bring up the Clinical Coordinator menu by typing **ORCL MENU** and pressing **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  Choose CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) … by typing **PE** and **\<Enter\>.**  
1.  Choose Allocate OE/RR Security Keys by typing **AL** and **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  Locate the key you want to assign (ORES, ORELSE, or OREMAS). To advance to the next key, type N and \<Enter\> at the Edit Holders: prompt.  
1.  When you locate the key you want to assign, at its Edit Holders prompt select **Y** and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  At the Select HOLDER: prompt, type the name of person to whom you will give the key and press **\<Enter\>**.  
1.  To give the key to additional users, continue typing the users’ names and pressing \<Enter\>.  
1.  When finished giving keys, press \<Enter\> at the Select HOLDER prompt to exit.  
1.  If necessary, type N and press \<Enter\> at the Edit Holders prompt to exit the Allocate OE/RR Key option.

### Group Note Entry Keys

The OR GN ACCESS key determines which providers can enter Group Notes using the new Group Notes application. To further enable sites to control creation of Group Notes, the Group Notes application restricts creation to designated locations that must be entered in the OR GN LOCATIONS parameter.

**Note:** For instructions on allocating this key and setting locations for group notes, please see the *Group Notes/Encounter Implementation Guide* under Group Notes on the Vista Documentation Library (http://www.va.gov/vdl/).  
### CPRS Tab Access and Reports-Only Access

To use the CPRS GUI, each user now must be given access to either all tabs or to only the CPRS Reports tab. If tabs are not assigned to the user in their NEW PERSON file or if the RESTRICT PATIENT SELECTION prompt does not contain a Yes or No, the CPRS GUI will abort when the user tries to login. This change is part of the Read-Only project and will give sites greater control over who has access to patient records during what time period and is in anticipation of further enhancements to CPRS.

*Note: Post-install code contained in a patch should set the “RESTRICTED PATIENT SELECTION” entry to “N” for all current CPRS GUI users, and create a default “COR” tab entry for them as well so that their access remains the same.*  
After the post-install routine has run, each time a new user is added to the system or if restricted access is needed for existing users, a Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or whoever is responsible for granting access to the CPRS GUI at each site, will have to assign the appropriate access. The settings to choose from are

COR All current CPRS GUI tabs  
RPT Reports tab  
Sites should assign either access to all tabs (COR) or just the Reports tab (RPT), but not both. Although CPRS will allow CACs or others to give both COR and RPT access at the same time, doing so it the same as giving the user access to all tabs.  
**Note:** If tab access is given for both COR and RPT with concurrent effective dates, the core tab access overrides the reports only access.  
One of the following four types of access would normally be granted:  
**Full Access to CPRS GUI for All Patients** – The user has no restrictions on which patients they can select (No) and the user can see all CPRS tabs, core access (COR).  
**Full Access to the CPRS GUI for a Restricted Patient List Only** – The user can only see a select group of patients (Yes with valid patient list specified) but can view all CPRS GUI tabs, core access (COR).  
**Reports Tab Access for a Restricted Patient List** – The user can only see a select group of patients, a restricted patient list (YES) with a valid patient list (valid list entered) and can view only the Reports tab (RPT).  
**Reports Tab Access for All Patients** – The user can see all patients (No), but can view only the Reports tab (RPT).  
The user will NOT be able to access CPRS if the site

does not assign tabs (COR or RPT) or the setting has expired  
does not answer Yes or No to patient list restriction  
answers Yes to patient list restriction, but does not assign a patient list  
**The following table is for reference only and shows all possible combinations**  
| Restrict Patient List? | OE/RR Team List           | Tabs Assigned | Result                                                                                                                                                          |

#### How Sites Can Restrict Access

Even with core access, sites can use the effective and expiration dates to control access to CPRS GUI. A CAC can assign the user core access for a specific period of time that the user will be at the site. Later, if access is needed again, the CAC can edit the existing entry to change the dates or leave that entry as a record and create a new tab access entry for the same tab with new dates. The user then has access to all CPRS GUI tabs and the full patient list for the period of time during which access is granted. To create a duplicate entry of the same tab, the user must select “No” when prompted for the new entry on a blank line.

Restricting core access by dates might be helpful if the CAC knows that a user will do a 90-day rotation. The CAC can set the user up to have core access for the period of time the user will be at the facility using the effective (or starting) date and the expiration date. Currently, an effective date is required for tab settings, but the expiration date is not.

However, of the two, read-only access is the more anticipated. Granting read-only access to CPRS involves assigning the reports tab only. In addition, the user can be assigned a restricted patient list, which is a previously created list in the OE/RR LIST FILE (\#100.21). The purpose of this feature is to allow non-clinical users, such as veterans’ service organizations (VSOs) or others who need to review the chart, to have access to the chart without being able to view the whole chart or make any changes to the chart. Setting the tab and a restricted list would allow these individuals to view only the reports tab of those patients they are assigned.

#### Technical Information

Kernel patches, XU\*8\*214 and XU\*8\*230, provide several new fields in the NEW PERSON (\#200) file for the following:

-   Whether the user’s access is restricted – RESTRICT PATIENT SELECTION (\#101.01)  
-   Which restricted patient list (team list) the user is assigned – PATIENT SELECTION LIST (\#101.02)  
-   Which tabs the user has been given access to and the dates – CPRS TAB (\#101.13 multiple)  
Within the CPRS TAB (\#101.13) multiple, is the CPRS TAB (\#.01) field which is a pointer to the new OR CPRS TABS (\#101.13) file. Additional fields within the CPRS TAB (\#101.13) multiple are EFFECTIVE DATE (\#.02) and EXPIRATION DATE (\#.03). The entries are made through the Clinical Coordinator menu using the GUI Access – Tabs, PL [ORCL CPRS ACCESS] option. In connection with the “Read Only” functionality, the Patient List utilized, which is based on an OE/RR LIST, is stored, displayed, scrolled, and refreshed fully from a \^TMP global.

#### Assigning CPRS GUI Tab Access

In order to assign CPRS tab access, you must be able to use the Clinical Coordinator menu in the List Manager interface. To grant restricted access to the CPRS GUI, an OERR List (file \#100.21) must be defined to contain the selected patients.

A new option has been added to the PE CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) [OR PARAM COORDINATOR MENU] entitled GA GUI Access - Tabs, PL [ORCL CPRS ACCESS].

To assign CPRS tab access for user, follow these steps:

1.  At the CPRS Configuration (Clinical Coordinator) Option prompt, type **GA** (for GUI Access – Tabs, PL) and press \<**Enter**\>.  
1.  At the Select NEW PERSON prompt, type the last name of the user and press \<**Enter**\>. If necessary, select from the choices given.  
1.  At the RESTRICTED PATIENT SELECTION prompt, type Y if you want to assign the user a specific Team List and press \<**Enter**\>. If you do not want to restrict the user’s access to a specific team list, type **N** and press \<**Enter**\>.  
**Note:** This prompt must be answered with a Yes or No. You can skip it, but if it is not answered, CPRS will abort when the user tries to run CPRS.  
1.  If you answered Yes to the prompt in step 5, at the PATIENT SELECTION LIST prompt, type the name of the list that was previously defined and assigned to the user using the Patient List Management Menu and press \<**Enter**\>.  
1.  Type the letters representing the tab or tab set (COR or RPT) that you want to assign to this user and press \<**Enter**\>.  
**Note:** To get the tab entry options, type **??** and press **\<Enter**\> as necessary. Remember that if you assign the user access to the core tabs (COR) that the user will have full access to CPRS. Also, if you are making a duplicate entry for the same tab such as “RPT” when an “RPT” already exists, you will need to answer N, to the REPORTS TAB? Ok? Yes// prompt to make the duplicate entry.  
1.  When asked if you are adding it as tab and no other entry exists, type **Y** and press \<**Enter**\>.  
1.  At the EFFECTIVE DATE prompt, type a date and press \<**Enter**\>.  
1.  At the EXPIRATION DATE prompt, you can type a date on which you want the access to expire and press \<**Enter**\> or you may press \<**Enter**\> without entering a date to bypass this prompt.  
1.  At the Select CPRS TAB prompt, if you have more editing to do, type which tab you want to edit or add. If you are done editing access press \<**Enter**\>.

## Appendix B: Electronic Signature

An electronic signature is the private code that an authorized user types into the system after performing certain actions. For CPRS, it’s used by clinicians entering orders. This signature has the same validity as the written signature on the chart.

Implementing electronic signature for CPRS is a four-step process:

1\. Define the clinician as a provider in the NEW PERSON file.  
2\. Assign the clinician the Provider key (while in the NEW PERSON file).  
3\. Assign the ORES key to clinicians who have signature authority.  
4\. Assign electronic signature codes (this can be done by the coordinator, at the same time as defining the clinician as a provider in the NEW PERSON file, or by the clinician, using *Electronic Signature Code Edit* on the User’s Toolbox menu. See instructions on following pages).  
Users may have the ORES key but not have an electronic signature code, and will, therefore, not be allowed to electronically sign orders on the system.

**☞NOTE:** **Until ORES key holders have an electronic signature code, the system assumes that orders entered have been entered and manually signed “on chart;” orders are automatically released to the ancillary service for action.**  
Once ORES key holders have an electronic signature code, they will be prompted to enter the electronic signature after accepting the orders. If the electronic signature code is entered correctly, the orders are released to the ancillary services for action. If the electronic signature code is not entered, or is entered incorrectly, the orders are *not* released to the ancillary services for action, but are held in an unreleased/unsigned status. Key holders are given three chances to correctly enter their signature codes.

GUI Review and Sign Works as Follows, According to Signature Status:

**• User has provider key only** (med student)  
If there are notes the user can sign, the ES panel appears in Review/Sign Changes; otherwise it is hidden. Orders appear on the list with the checkbox grayed. If the ES is entered for documents, it is NOT applied to the orders.  
**• User has OREMAS key**  
If users (clerks) have entered notes for which they are the author AND orders on behalf of a provider, TWO review screens will appear⎯one prompting for ES for the things the clerk can sign (a note), and one to allow the clerk to process the orders (mark signed on chart).  
**• User has ORELSE key**  
Works the same as for clerks, but the user can also release the orders.  
**• User has ORES key**  
Sees the review screen with the ES prompting, both for notes and orders.  
#### Electronic Signature Edit Option

Key holders may enter or edit their electronic signature codes through the option, “Electronic Signature Edit,” on the User’s Toolbox menu. To change an existing code, the user must type in the current code and then enter the new one.

##### Setup of Electronic Signature

If key holders forget their electronic signature codes, they must contact their IRM Service so that the old code can be deleted. Once this has been done, the user will be allowed to enter a new code without having to know the old code. IRM staff can delete the electronic signature code by editing the field, ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CODE (20.4) in the NEW PERSON file (200), or by using the option, “Clear Electronic Signature Code [XUSESIG CLEAR].”  
| **ORDER PARAMETERS File (100.99)** **Field 100.99,21 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE**  '0' FOR NO;  '1' FOR YES;  This field allows electronic signature functionality to be used. Use of this functionality requires some initial setup before it can be turned on. Users have to be assigned keys that allow them to perform verification steps in the order entry process. They also have to be given an electronic signature code. This also has an effect on who can be selected as the person requesting the order.  **Field 100.99,22 ELECTRONIC RECORD**  '3' FOR YES (ALLOW S.O.C & WRITTEN);  '4' FOR YES (Exempt Service Entered);  A site can use this field to select 1 of 4 modes for Electronic Signature:  **0\> No change** from current Electronic Signature functionality.  **1\> Yes (All orders must be signed online.)**  Signature on chart is not allowed All orders are filed initially with a signature status of Unsigned and a notification for electronic signature is sent to the ordering provider.  **Yes (Allow S.O.C)**  All orders are signed online, but for those cases where an order is written and signed on the paper chart, you can so specify. Backdoor orders send a notification for electronic signature and require a signature, unless the order has a Nature of Order set to null.  **Yes (Allow S.O.C. & Written)**  Is the same as option 2 except that it will allow orders sent from the ancillary packages with a nature of order of Written to be entered without requiring an electronic signature.  **Yes (Exempt Service Entered)**  Is the same as option 2 except that it will allow orders sent from the ancillary packages that have not defined a nature of order to be entered without requiring an electronic signature. This is the way 'backdoor' orders were handled before the changes introduced with this new field (added with patch OR\*2.5\*46) were added. As of the release of patch OR\*2.5\*46 only Pharmacy and Lab have a way of dealing with the nature of order from the backdoor. So until the rest of the backdoor interfaces can deal with this, option 4 is the least disruptive method of evolution, and still get the enhancements for notification and signing of verbal orders.  For options 1, 2, 3 and 4, the default for the prompt "Do you want to mark these orders as 'Signed on Chart'" is changed to NO.  |

### Digital Signature

As part of the Drug Enforcement Agency Electronic Prescription of Controlled Substances (DEA ePCS) project, CPRS uses digital signatures for outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To digitally sign the outpatient controlled substance order, a provider must have a Personal Identification Verification card (PIV) or smart card, a computer that accepts the card, and a Personal Identification Number (PIN). In addition, to electronically place the outpatient controlled substance orders, a provider must be correctly set up in VistA with several credential items, such as a DEA or VA number, keys, entries in file, and other items.

Orders that require digital signatures go through the electronic signature process first. Then, providers must acknowledge the text on the dialog by entering their PIV (also referred to as a smart card) and entering their PIN when prompted.

## Appendix C: How Notifications Work - Technical Overview

### Introduction

In CPRS, most Notifications will be triggered by examining data in HL7 messages. (In limited cases, they will be triggered within individual packages.) As packages update and pass pertinent data in HL7 arrays via protocol event points, the CPRS Expert System will capture and examine those messages and data to determine if a notification should be triggered. The HL7 message data capture and review process is similar to that required by Order Checking which also uses the CPRS Expert System. When compared with order checks, the delivery mechanism for notifications is non-real time with a different destination. (For a detailed comparison of Notifications and Order Checks, refer to the Notifications document entitled, “Notifications, Order Checks and Kernel Alerts”.) To support this new direction for notifications, the Notifications file has been altered. Some of the information that used to reside in the Notifications file has been moved to the Parameter files.

### Trigger Methods

Notifications are triggered via six methods:

1\. Hard coded triggers within packages; for example: Imaging Patient Examined  
2\. Time (TaskMan)-driven processes; for example: Medications Expiring - Inpt  
3\. Expert system rules monitoring HL7 messages; for example: Critical Lab Results  
4\. Expert system rules monitoring DGPM Movement Events protocol; for example: Discharge  
5\. Expert system rules monitoring OE/RR Events; for example: Order Requires Elec Signature  
6\. Order checking system; for example: Order Check  
The processing of notifications is determined by information evaluated during the triggering process and the values of parameters set by options in the ORB namespace. For a description of these parameters, refer to Parameters document “Notification Parameters in CPRS 1 - Technical Overview”.

### Recipient Determination

CPRS Notifications determines recipients of a patient’s particular notification/alert in the following order.

**☞ NOTE: Terminated users will not receive notifications/alerts.**  
1\. Check the value of the parameter ORB SYSTEM ENABLE/ DISABLE. If it is ‘D’isabled, do not process or send any notifications. If it is ‘E’nabled, process notifications as outlined below.  
**☞ NOTE: You can check the value of this parameter via option “Enable or Disable Notification System.”**  
2\. Obtain the default/regular recipients for this notification regardless of patient from the parameter ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS.  
**☞ NOTE: You can access this parameter via option “Set Default Recipients for Notifications.” With this option, teams and individuals can be set up to automatically always receive a particular notification. If a team is identified, every user on that team (regardless of other parameter and option settings), will receive the notification/alert. Good uses of this parameter include troubleshooting notifications and delivering the Food/Drug Interaction notification (for all patients), to a team of dietitians.**  
3\. Obtain the default/regular device recipients for this notification regardless of patient from the parameter ORB DEFAULT DEVICE RECIPIENTS.  
**☞ NOTE: This parameter is accessed via option “Set Default Recipient Device(s) for Notifications.” One or more devices can be set up to automatically always receive a notification. The device may be a printer, file or any other device defined at the site. This is useful if every instance of an alert across all patients is desired for QA, JCAHO or research purposes.**  
4\. After default recipients are determined, a list of potential alert recipients is obtained from:  
a. Special, notification-specific recipients:  
1) If the notification processed is FLAGGED OI RESULTS - INPT/OUTPT (usually triggered by an HL7 result message from Lab, Imaging or Consults), the orderable item associated with the notification’s order number is found. The parameter ORB OI RESULTS – INPT/OUTPT is then evaluated to determine if users, teams or devices have flagged that orderable item. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL patients. If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
**☞ NOTE: If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.**  
**☞ NOTE: You can check for users or teams linked to flagged orderable item results via option “Flag Orderable Item(s) to Send Notifications.”**  
2) If the notification processed is FLAGGED OI ORDER - INPT/OUTPT (usually triggered by an HL7 order message from OE/RR or a backdoor ancillary package order), the orderable item associated with the notification’s order number is found. The parameter ORB OI ORDERED – INPT/OUTPT is then evaluated to determine if users or teams have flagged that orderable item. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL patients. If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team.  
**☞ NOTE: If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.)**  
Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
**☞ NOTE: If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.**  
**☞ NOTE: You can check for users or teams linked to flagged orderable item orders via option “Flag Orderable Item(s) to Send Notifications.”**  
3) If the notification processed is FLAGGED OI EXPIRING - INPT/OUTPT (triggered when an order will expire before midnight on the next working day), the orderable item associated with the notification’s order number is found. The parameter ORB OI EXPIRING – INPT/OUTPT is then evaluated to determine if users or teams have flagged that orderable item. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL patients. If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team.  
**☞ NOTE: If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.**  
Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
**☞ NOTE: If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.**  
**☞ NOTE: You can check for users or teams linked to expiring flagged orderable items via option “Flag Orderable Item(s) to Send Notifications.”**  
4) If a lab results notification is processed (LAB RESULTS, ABNORMAL LAB RESULTS (ACTION), STAT RESULTS, CRITICAL LAB RESULTS (ACTION)), the unique lab ID (e.g., “1916;2990506;9;CH;7009492.9046”), for the notification is obtained. The patient’s existing alerts are then reviewed for matching notifications and unique lab IDs. If a matching alert is found that alert’s recipients are added to the potential recipient list. In addition, the matching alert’s message text is prefixed to the current alert’s message text and the matching alert is deleted.  
b. The optional recipient list identified by the service triggering the alert. For example, Radiology sends Notifications a list of potential recipients when its STAT Imaging Request notification is triggered.  
c. Provider-related recipients indicated in the parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS:  
1) “P” – Primary Provider (inpatient)  
2) “A” – Attending Physician  
3) “T” – Teams. If set for Teams, all OE/RR teams to which the patient belongs will be evaluated to obtain potential recipients from the set of users also on the teams. A user on multiple teams with the patient will be processed for each team that has an Enabled, Disabled or Mandatory value for that notification. Thus it is possible for one team membership to “disable” a user’s alert whereas another team membership “enables” the user’s alert, all for the same patient.  
4) “O” – Ordering Provider. If set for ordering/requesting provider and an order number is passed by the service/HL7 message triggering the alert, the ordering/requesting provider will be determined and added to the potential list.  
**☞ NOTE: If the notification is either Order Requires Electronic Signature or Order Requires Co-signature and the ordering/requesting provider does not have signature authority (does not hold the ORES key), the teams that contain both the ordering/requesting provider and patient will be evaluated. Every user with the ORES key on those teams will be added to the potential recipient list.**  
5) “M” – PCMM Team. If set for PCMM Teams, adds users/providers linked to the patient’s primary PCMM team via PCMM Team Position assignments to the potential recipient list.  
6) “E” – Entering User. If set for entering user and an order number is passed by the service/HL7 message triggering the alert, the user/provider who entered the order’s most recent activity will be added to the potential recipient list.  
7) “R” – PCMM Primary Care Practitioner (PCP)  
8) “S” – PCMM Associate Provider  
**☞ NOTE: You can access the ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS parameter value via option “Set Provider Recipients for Notifications.”**  
5\. Obtain a list of the previous "single instance" alert recipients who have NOT deleted the alert and add them as potential recipients to the new alert. As potential recipients, these previous recipients go through the same "ON/OFF" algorithm to determine if they should actually receive the new alert or not. Single instance notifications/alerts that delete the previous instance of the alert and obtain potential recipients for the new alert from the previous alert include:  
DC ORDER  
DNR EXPIRING  
FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION  
MEDICATIONS EXPIRING – INPT  
MEDICATIONS EXPIRING – OUTPT  
NEW ORDER  
NPO DIET MORE THAN 72 HRS  
ORDER REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE  
UNVERIFIED MEDICATION ORDER  
UNVERIFIED ORDER  
6\. Each user on the potential recipient list is evaluated according to values set for entities identified in the parameter ORB PROCESSING FLAG.  
**☞ NOTE: You can access these entity values via options “Enable/Disable Notifications” and “Display the Notifications a User Can Receive.”**  
The parameter’s entity values are processed in the following order to determine if that particular user should receive the notification/alert or not.  
**☞ NOTE: Terminated users will not receive notifications/ alerts.**  
If a user on the recipient list has the notification “ON” (they will receive the alert). If the user has Kernel Alert surrogate, the surrogate will receive the alert. The original user will not receive the alert if he has a surrogate!  
**The first condition met below stops the processing and determines whether or not the user will receive the notification.** These conditions are summarized as a matrix in Appendix A. Processing order:  
a. If the USER’s value for the notification is Mandatory or Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
b. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
c. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
d. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
e. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
f. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
g. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Mandatory (and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION has no value), the user will receive the alert.  
h. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Mandatory (and DIVISION and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION have no value), the user will receive the alert.  
i. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Mandatory (and SYSTEM, DIVISION\*, and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION have no value), the user will receive the alert.  
j. If the USER’s value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
k. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
l. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
m. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
n.. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
o. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
p. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
q. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
r. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
s. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
t. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
u. If none of the above parameter values are found, the notification is processed as Disabled and the user will NOT receive the alert.  
**☞ NOTE: All notifications will have a value (Enabled, Disabled or Mandatory), at the package level when exported.**  
**☞ NOTE: \*If the user has multiple divisions, the first division found with a “Mandatory” value is used. If no mandatory division values exist and a division has an “Enabled” value, that division is used. If neither mandatory nor enabled division values exist and a division has a “Disabled” value, that division is used.**  
### Notification Specifics

Each notification and how it works is described below. In most cases, Recipients, Urgency and Deletion can be set at the site via ORB options/parameters. The values indicated below for Recipients, Urgency and Deletion are those exported by CPRS as package entity, (OE/RR) defaults.  
**Local Notifications**  
It is possible for sites to create their own local notifications. Sites that create their own notifications are responsible for the content and maintenance of them. Part of creating a local notification is creating a number for that notification. A range of national numbers is set aside for nationally released notifications.  
Local notifications must be assigned a number in the local site range.  
**Warning:** If a local notification has a national number, it could be overwritten when a national notification is released. You could lose your local notification.  
**Renumbering a Site-Defined Notification**  
Create an entry in the OE/RR Notifications file [\#100.9]. This entry must have a unique, descriptive name and unique internal entry number. In addition, the internal entry number must be specific to your VAMC in the following format:  
\<your station number\>\<incremental notification number ranging from 01-99\>  
For example, if your site is number 456, your first locally created notification would be 45601. All "site-defined" notifications must be defined similarly to the following example:  
NUMBER: \<site number\>\<incremental number\>  
NAME: \<unique site name\>  
PACKAGE ID: OR MESSAGE TEXT: \<alert message text\>  
MESSAGE TYPE: PACKAGE PROVIDES A VARIABLE MESSAGE  
ACTION FLAG: RUN ROUTINE ENTRY POINT: INFODEL  
ROUTINE NAME: ORB3FUP2  
\*RECIPIENT RESTRICTIONS: RESTRICTED TO PACKAGE-DEFINED RECIPIENTS  
RELATED PACKAGE: OR  
\*PROCESSING FLAG: ENABLED  
DESCRIPTION: \<description of the notification\>  
**Note:** Site-defined notifications CANNOT have follow-up actions. (Notifications with follow-up actions must have follow-up action code written for both the ListMgr and GUI interfaces. Currently, this requires the source code to the GUI which is not available.) Therefore, the entry point must be INFODEL and routine name ORB3FUP2.  
**National Notifications**  
Nationally released notifications have a specific number range. These national notifications are described below.

**Consult/Request Updated [CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED]**  
**Trigger:** Within Consults package when a user takes the Receive or Schedule actions or adds a comment. [GMRC\*3\*29 changed the way consult comment alerts work. While there is still functionality to send a comment optionally as an alert to one or more persons, the software now makes this work more along the lines of 'automatic' consult activity alerts for IFC requests. Specifically: 1) if the consult requestor makes a comment, the alert is automatically sent to the usual consult alert recipients; 2) if a consult receiver makes a comment, the alert is automatically sent to the consult requestor; 3) if the user making a comment is a 3rd-party (i.e. NEITHER the consult requestor or one of the usual consult service alert recipients), then the alert for the comment action is sent to BOTH the consult requestor and to all the usual consult service alert recipients.]

[OR\*3\*452 and GMRC\*3\*91 altered recipient behavior such that, if a person(s) has been added as a recipient via “Send additional alerts”, then those recipients will receive the alert even if they have disabled the alert.

**DNR Order Nearing Expiration [DNR EXPIRING]**  
**Trigger:** ORMTIME monitored process (site determined - commonly 30 minutes).  
**Mechanism:** Taskman invokes ORMTIME which calls ORMTIM01 which calls EXPIR\^ORB31. ORB31 searches for a DNR order expiring within 24 hours (72 hours on Fridays.) Exceptions, (alert is not triggered) include: deceased patients and orders with a status of discontinued, complete, expired, discontinued/edit.  
**Note:** For this notification to work, two site setups must be completed:

1\. A link must exist between the nation term, “DNR”, and each site’s local orderable item that denotes DNR.\|
2\. One of more order dialogs must use the DNR orderable items.

Therefore when an order with a DNR orderable item linked to the national term “DNR” is found to be expiring before midnight on the next working day, the alert is sent. The date range to search for expiring DNR orders is based upon day of week and entries in the Holiday file. The range is extended to include all expiring DNR orders through the next working day (excluding holidays and weekends.) The new alert also deletes the previous instance of this alert if the previous alert is undeleted. (Only one instance of this alert can exist for the patient at any one time.)  
**Message:** DNR order nearing expiration  
**Follow-up:** Display DNR order and allow renewal.

**Flagged Orderable Item Expiring - Inpatient [FLAGGED OI EXPIRING – INPT]**  
**Trigger:** ORMTIME monitored process (site determined - commonly 30 minutes).  
**Mechanism:** Taskman invokes ORMTIME which calls ORMTIM01 which calls EXPIR\^ORB31. ORB31 searches for expiring orders for the patient based on entries in the \^OR(100,”AE” x-ref. The date range to search is based upon day of week and entries in the Holiday file. The range is extended to include all expiring med orders through the next working day (excluding holidays and weekends.) Alert is not triggered if patient is deceased or an outpatient.  
**Message:** [\<pt location\>] Order expiring: \<oi name\> \<order start D/T\>  
**Follow-up:** Display orders expiring through the next working day and allow renewal.
EXOI\^ORB3FUP2  
**Recipients:** Recipients for this notification are not based specifically on patient. They are based on orderable item. Users, OE/RR Teams and Devices can receive this alert for specific orderable items by flagging the orderable items via parameter ORB OI EXPIRING - INPT. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL patients. If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient.  
**Note:** If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.  
Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team.  
**Note:** If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.  
Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team. Recipients can also be identified via the parameter ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS. ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS can be set at the User and Team levels. Devices can be identified as recipients via the option ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES. ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES can be set at the Division and System levels. Like other notifications, recipients can also be identified via parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. Values are set for these parameters by an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.  
**Note:** ORMTIME-driven alerts use the System Postmaster’s as the triggering DUZ. The standard for Postmaster DUZ is a value less than one. When processing alerts for triggering users with a DUZ less than one, the DUZ of the Ordering Provider (based upon order number), is used to determine which Division to use for parameters.  
**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.  
**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual review via View Alerts.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Flagged Orderable Item Ordered - Inpatient [FLAGGED OI ORDER – INPT]**  
**Trigger:** Expert system rule intercepts HL7 message.
SITEORD\^ORB3F1  
**Mechanism:** Expert system checks the parameter ORB OI ORDERED – INPT to determine if the orderable item for the order has been flagged to trigger a notification when it is ordered. The expert system also checks the Order Control Code (ORC 1). It must be NW or SN. If the order was placed via the “backdoor” (through lab, pharmacy, etc.) and not through CPRS, an OE/RR order must be included with the “SN” order control code. Therefore, in many backdoor order cases (such as lab backdoor orders), the alert is not sent because an order number is not in the HL7 message. Also the patient must be an INPATIENT as determined by compiler function PATLOC.  
**Note:** The orderable item identified via the parameter must match the order’s orderable item. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup.  
**Message:** [\<pt location\>] Order placed: \<oi name\> \<order start D/T\>  
**Follow-up:** NA  
**Recipients:** Recipients for this notification are not based specifically on patient. They are based on orderable item. Users, OE/RR Teams and Devices can receive this alert for specific orderable items by flagging the orderable items via parameter ORB OI ORDERED - INPT.

ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Note:** The Lab Results notification is exported as ‘Disabled’ due to the high volume of alerts it generates. Sites can selectively enable this notification for individuals, teams, etc.

**Lab Threshold Exceeded [LAB THRESHOLD EXCEEDED]**

**Trigger:** Expert system rule intercepts HL7 message.

**Mechanism:** The expert system checks the parameters ORB LAB \> THRESHOLD and ORB LAB \< THRESHOLD for greater and less than threshold values for the resulted lab test. If a threshold value is found and the result value exceeds the parameter’s threshold value, a notification/alert is triggered. Additional data that must be present to trigger the notification/alert include an Order Control Code (ORC 1) of RE and an OBX 11 (result status) of F or C.

**Message:** [\<pt location\>] Lab threshold exceeded – [\<orderable item name\>]

**Follow-up:** Display lab results.
RPTLAB\^ORB3FUP2

**Recipients:** Recipients for this notification are not based specifically on patient. Target recipients are determined within the MLM Lab Threshold relation when the relation’s Execute Code is triggered. Recipients are users who have indicated upper and/or lower threshold values for lab tests and are linked to the patient. A user is considered linked to the patient if they are the patient's Inpatient Primary Provider, Attending Physician, PCMM Primary Provider or PCMM Associate Provider. A user is also considered linked if they share an OE/RR or PCMM team with the patient. When a result exceeds a threshold value, the user setting the threshold receives an alert message (if they are linked to the patient.) Recipients can also be identified via the parameter ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS. ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS can be set at the User and Team levels. Devices can be identified as recipients via the option ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES. ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES can be set at the Division and System levels. Like other notifications, recipients can also be identified via parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. Values are set for these parameters by an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is Moderate. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual review via View Alerts.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Lactation Status Review (LACTATION STATUS REVIEW]**

**Trigger:** Within Clinical Reminders software package

**Mechanism:** The PXRM PATIENT PTF DATA CHANGE protocol monitors changes in inpatient PTF (DG PTF ICD DIAGNOSIS NOTIFIER), the PXRM PATIENT PROBLEM DATA CHANGE protocol monitors changes in problem list (GMPL EVENT) and the PXRM PATIENT DATA CHANGE protocol monitors changes in PCE (PXK VISIT DATA EVENT). When an ICD code indicates a patient’s lactation status is different from the lactation status stored in the Women’s Health software package, this notification is generated.

**Message:** Variable

**Follow-up:** User must complete the reminder dialog that appears

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Primary, Attending, Teams, PCMM Team, PCMM Primary Care, PCMM Associate and PCMM Mental Health Treatment Coordinator.

RPTRAD2\^ORB3FUP2

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. There is no exported value for this notification. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is Moderate. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual review via View Alerts.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Medications Nearing Expiration [MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - INPT]**

**Trigger:** ORMTIME monitored process (site determined - commonly 30 minutes).

**Mechanism:** TaskMan invokes ORMTIME which calls ORMTIM01 which calls EXPIR\^ORB3TIM2. ORB3TIM2 searches for expiring medication orders for the patient based on entries in the \^OR(100,”AE” x-ref. The date range to search is based upon day of week and entries in the Holiday file. The range is extended to include all expiring med orders through the next working day (excluding holidays and weekends.) Alert is not triggered if patient is deceased or an outpatient, order is a one-time medication, medication is an outpatient prescription, medication is not renewable or the expiration date is not at least one day after the order’s date of last activity. The new alert also deletes the previous instance of this alert if the previous alert is undeleted. (Only one instance of this alert can exist for the patient at any one time.) This alert also has to be enabled in CPRS – Tools/Option.

**Message:** Medications nearing expiration.

**Follow-up:** Display medication orders expiring through the next working day and allow renewal.
EXMED\^ORB3FUP2

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Ordering Provider, Attending, Primary, Teams. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Note:** ORMTIME-driven alerts use the System Postmaster’s as the triggering DUZ. The standard for Postmaster DUZ is a value less than one. When processing alerts for triggering users with a DUZ less than one, the DUZ of the Ordering Provider (based upon order number), is used to determine which Division to use for parameters.

Alert also sent to previous recipients of this patient/alert if the previous alert is undeleted and recipient is still linked to the patient.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is All Recipients (Completion of follow-up action, which is renewal or Dcing of all medication orders nearing expiration, by one recipient deletes the alert for all recipients.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Medications Nearing Expiration [MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - OUTPT]**

**Trigger:** ORMTIME monitored process (site determined - commonly 30 minutes).

**Mechanism:** Taskman invokes ORMTIME which calls ORMTIM01 which calls EXPIR\^ORB31. ORB31 searches for expiring medication orders for the patient based on entries in the \^OR(100,”AE” x-ref. The date range to search is based upon day of week and entries in the Holiday file. The range is extended to include all expiring med orders through the next working day (excluding holidays and weekends.) Alert is triggered if patient is an outpatient. The new alert also deletes the previous instance of this alert if the previous alert is undeleted. (Only one instance of this alert can exist for the patient at any one time.)

**Message:** Medications nearing expiration.

**Follow-up:** Display medication orders expiring through the next working day and allow renewal.
EXMED\^ORB3FUP2

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Ordering Provider, Attending, Primary, Teams. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Note:** ORMTIME-driven alerts use the System Postmaster’s as the triggering DUZ. The standard for Postmaster DUZ is a value less than one. When processing alerts for triggering users with a DUZ less than one, the DUZ of the Ordering Provider (based upon order number), is used to determine which Division to use for parameters.

Alert also sent to previous recipients of this patient/alert if the previous alert is undeleted and recipient is still linked to the patient.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is All Recipients (Completion of follow-up action, which is renewal or Dcing of all medication orders nearing expiration, by one recipient deletes the alert for all recipients.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**New Allergy Entered/Active Med [NEW ALLERGY ENTERED/ACTIVE MED]**

**Trigger:**  Within Order Entry Results Reporting package (SENDALRT\^ORWDAL32).

**Mechanism:** When a new allergy is entered in CPRS GUI, a check is made for existing medication orders which result in an allergy order check for the newly entered allergy. For every order identified, an alert will be sent via an RPC (ORWDAL32 SENDALRT).

**Message:** Review New Allergy Entered on Active Med

**Follow-up:** Opens Orders tab in CPRS GUI with a New Allergy Conflict view displaying the specific order that caused the notification.

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported values for this notification are the Primary Provider and Ordering Provider.

Alert also sent to user selected recipients at time of generation of alert.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual completion of follow-up action.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU. This alert is deleted when a recipient reviews the patient’s new orders via the View Alert follow-up action.

**New Order Placed [NEW ORDER]**

**Trigger:** Expert system rule intercepts HL7 message.

**Mechanism:** If ORC 1 (order control) is ‘NW’ (new from OE/RR), ‘SN’ (new from backdoor pkg) or “XR” (changed as requested). The new alert also deletes the previous instance of this alert if the previous alert is undeleted. (Only one instance of this alert can exist for the patient at any one time.)

**Message:** [\<pt location\>] New order(s) placed.

**Follow-up:** Display “recent activity” orders for that patient. “Recent activity” orders are those with an activity which occurred within the current 24 hour day (midnight –midnight.) Orders with a status of DISCONTINUED, COMPLETE, HOLD, FLAGGED, PENDING, ACTIVE, EXPIRED, SCHEDULED, PARTIAL RESULTS, DISCONTINUED/EDIT or RENEWED are displayed.
NEWORD\^ORB3FUP1

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Teams. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU. Alert also sent to previous recipients of this patient/alert if the previous alert is undeleted and recipient is still linked to the patient. This notification was designed to allow nurses (and perhaps clerks), on teams to be notified when a physician enters a new order for a patient cared for by that team. This notification is triggered with every new order placed (it happens often), so it should be disabled for the site with the exception of the nurse/clerk teams when it should be enabled. Enabling and disabling of notifications is accomplished via the parameter ORB PROCESSING FLAG which can be set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is Moderate. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual completion of follow-up action.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU. This alert is deleted when a recipient reviews the patient’s new orders via the View Alert follow-up action.

**Note:** The New Order notification is exported as ‘Disabled’ due to the high volume of alerts it generates. Sites can selectively enable this notification for individuals, teams, etc.

**New Service Consult/Request [NEW SERVICE CONSULT/REQUEST]**

**Trigger:** Within Consults package (MSG\^GMRCP)

**Mechanism:** Consults package determines a new consult has been requested.

**Message:** New consult \<consult name or type\> (\<urgency\>)

**Follow-up:** Display Consult/Request and allow user to take action on it.
NEWCON\^ORB3FUP2

**Recipients:** Users passed from Consults in ORBADUZ:
 User entered at “Attention:” prompt during ordering process.

User entered at “SERVICE INDIVIDUAL TO NOTIFY:” for consulting service.
 Users on teams entered at “SERVICE TERM TO NOFITY:” for consulting service.
 If consulting service has “YES” entered at “PROCESS PARENTS FOR NOTIFS:”,
 users and users on team entered at SERVICE INDIVIDUAL/TEAM TO NOTIFY in
 parent services are also added as potential recipients. (This moves up the hierarchy
 until a “NO” is encountered at the “PROCESS PARENTS FOR NOTIFS:” prompt.)

Additional recipients determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. There is no exported recipient value for this notification. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**NPO Diet for more than 72 Hours [NPO DIET MORE THAN 72 HRS]**

**Trigger:** ORMTIME monitored process (site determined - commonly 30 minutes).

**Mechanism:** Taskman invokes ORMTIME which calls ORMTIM01 which calls NPO\^ORB31. ORB31 searches for NPO orders which have existed for more than 72 hours. Orders with a status of DC, Expired, Cancelled, Lapsed, Complete, Changed and Released do not trigger this notification/alert. The new alert also deletes the previous instance of this alert if the previous alert is undeleted. (Only one instance of this alert can exist for the patient at any one time.)

**Note:** For this notification to work, two site setups must be completed: 1) a link must exist between the national term “NPO” and each site’s local orderable item that denotes NPO, and 2) one or more order dialogs must use the NPO orderable items. Therefore when an order with a NPO orderable item linked to the national term “NPO” is found to be expiring within 72 hours, the alert is sent.

**Message:** NPO Diet for more than 72 hours.

**Follow-up:** NA

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Ordering Provider. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU

**Note:** ORMTIME-driven alerts use the System Postmaster’s as the triggering DUZ. The standard for Postmaster DUZ is a value less than one. When processing alerts for triggering users with a DUZ less than one, the DUZ of the Ordering Provider (based upon order number), is used to determine which Division to use for parameters.

Alert also sent to previous recipients of this patient/alert if the previous alert is undeleted and recipient is still linked to the patient.

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is Moderate. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is Individual Recipient (Individual completion of follow-up action.) ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Message:** Order requires electronic signature.

**Follow-up:** Display orders requiring electronic signature and allow electronic signature.
ESORD\^ORB3FUP1

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Ordering Provider (or user entering an unsigned change to an existing order), Attending, Primary, Teams. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU. Alert also sent to previous recipients of this patient/alert if the previous alert is undeleted and recipient is still linked to the patient.

**Note:** When considering OE/RR or PCMM teams for potential recipients, only those teams linked to the patient are evaluated for potential recipients. If the ordering provider does not have the ORES key, users on OE/RR teams linked to the ordering provider and patient are added to the potential recipient list (if the user has ORES.)

**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Deletion:** Determined by parameter ORB DELETE MECHANISM. The exported value for this notification is All Recipients (Completion of follow-up action, which is electronic signature of all orders requiring electronic signature, by one recipient deletes the alert for all recipients.) Also deleted on print event when notification is changed from Order Requires Electronic Signature to Order Requires Chart Signature and resent. ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

**Note:** The following two exception conditions exist when determining how alert deletion will occur. In all other cases, alert deletion will occur when the patient has no unsigned orders.

1) If the recipient of this alert does NOT have the ORES key, the alert will be deleted for that recipient after he reviews the unsigned orders.

2) If the recipient has the ORES key and is NOT linked to the patient as attending physician, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, his alert will be deleted when his unsigned orders are signed. (If unsigned orders written by other providers for the patient remain, alerts for these other providers will not be deleted.) For example, a consulting surgeon (with ORES) places three unsigned orders for a patient. He then receives an “Order requires electronic signature” alert for the patient. He uses the View Alerts follow-up action and is presented with ten unsigned orders for the patient. Only three of the ten orders are his. The surgeon signs his three unsigned orders. If the surgeon is not linked to the patient as attending, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, the alert will be deleted (for him only.)

In most cases alert deletion will occur when the patient has no unsigned orders. For example, if a recipient has the ORES key and is linked to the patient as attending, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, all unsigned orders for the patient must be signed before his alert is deleted.

**Orderer-Flagged Order Result(s) Available [ORDERER-FLAGGED RESULTS]**

**Trigger:** Expert system rules monitoring OE/RR Events.

**Mechanism:** User selects an order then Action item ‘Alert Results’ from the OE/RR Orders screen. User then enters the name of the intended alert recipient. OE/RR determines an order has been flagged and invokes the CPRS Expert System via EN\^OCXOERR. The expert system tracks that order by checking HL7 messages. The notification is triggered when the final HL7 results are returned from the filling package with an Order Control Code (ORC 1) of RE and OBR 25 (request status) must be F. (This notification is currently available for lab, consults and radiology results only.)

**Message:** Requested results available: \<orderable item, order D/T\>

**Follow-up:** Display lab, consults, or radiology results.

### How to Edit Local Site Terms

Before you edit the Local Site Terms, you may want to check what terms are currently mapped.

The following is an example of an inquiry into the file using FileMan.

VA FileMan 22.0  
Select OPTION NAME: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES  
***

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: ORDER CHECK ELEMENT//  
Select ORDER CHECK ELEMENT NAME: INPATIENT FOOD-DRUG REACTION  
***

NAME: INPATIENT FOOD-DRUG REACTION  
ELEMENT CONTEXT: GENERIC HL7 MESSAGE ARRAY  
EXPRESSION SEQUENCE NUMBER: 1 DATA FIELD 1: FOOD-DRUG  
INTERACTION MED  
OPERATOR/FUNCTION: LOGICAL TRUE  
CONDITIONAL VALUE 1:  
COUMADIN,WARFARIN, DISULFIRAM, PHENELZINE, TRANYLCYPROMINE, PARNATE \<======

OPERATOR/FUNCTION: EQUALS ELEMENT IN SET  
CONDITIONAL VALUE 1: NW,SN  
EXPRESSION SEQUENCE NUMBER: 4 DATA FIELD 1: INPATIENT  
OPERATOR/FUNCTION: LOGICAL TRUE  
You must use the Order Check Mgmt option "Edit Site Local Terms" to re-add the hard-coded medication terms. (The CPRS default list included COUMADIN/WARFARIN, DISULFIRAM, PHENELZINE, TRANYLCYPROMINE and PARNATE.) You can also use the option to add any new medications desired by your site. When mapping the old, default medication terms to the new national term FOOD-DRUG INTERACTION MED, the default medication terms may not map directly to medication orderable items. You may need assistance from a pharmacist to make the appropriate mapping. For example, mapping "WARFARIN" to "WARFARIN TAB" is straightforward but there may be other orderable item forms of warfarin in your system that should also be mapped. It is best to do this mapping during off-peak hours because the CPRS Expert System is automatically recompiled after a local term is added, modified or removed. During compilation, some order checks and notifications/alerts are taken off-line.

###

**Recipients:** Determined by parameter ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS. The exported value for this notification is Ordering Provider, Attending, Primary, Teams. ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.  
**☞ NOTE:  When considering OE/RR or PCMM teams for potential recipients, only those teams linked to the patient are evaluated for potential recipients. If the ordering provider does not have the ORES key, users on OE/RR teams linked to the ordering provider and patient are added to the potential recipient list (if the user has ORES.)**  
**Urgency:** Determined by parameter ORB URGENCY. The exported value for this notification is High. ORB URGENCY can be set at the User, Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.

Also deleted on print event when notification is changed from Order Requires Electronic Signature to Order Requires Chart Signature and resent. ORB DELETE MECHANISM can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under menu options ORB NOT MGR MENU and ORB NOT COORD MENU.  
**☞ NOTE:  The following two exception conditions exist when determining how alert deletion will occur. In all other cases, alert deletion will occur when the patient has no unsigned orders.**  
**1) If the recipient of this alert does NOT have the ORES key, the alert will be deleted for that recipient after he reviews the unsigned orders.**  
**2) If the recipient has the ORES key and is NOT linked to the patient as attending physician, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, his alert will be deleted when his unsigned orders are signed. (If unsigned orders written by other providers for the patient remain, alerts for these other providers will not be deleted.) For example, a consulting surgeon (with ORES) places three unsigned orders for a patient. He then receives an “Order requires electronic signature” alert for the patient. He uses the View Alerts follow-up action and is presented with ten unsigned orders for the patient. Only three of the ten orders are his. The surgeon signs his three unsigned orders. If the surgeon is not linked to the patient as attending, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, the alert will be deleted (for him only.)**  
**In most cases alert deletion will occur when the patient has no unsigned orders. For example, if a recipient has the ORES key and is linked to the patient as attending, inpatient primary provider, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or via OE/RR or PCMM teams, all unsigned orders for the patient must be signed before his alert is deleted.]**

**Pregnancy/Lactation Unsafe Order Review [PREG/LACT UNSAFE ORDERS]**  
**Trigger:** Patient is documented as pregnant and/or lactating in the Women’s Health package  
**Mechanism:** A trigger within the PREGNANCY STATUSES (\#40) and LACTATION STATUSES (\#50) multiple fields within the WV PATIENT file (\#790) executes an order review when the patient is documented as pregnant or lactating. This trigger uses the Clinical Reminder order check system to review pending and active medication and radiology orders to determine which orders require review given the change in the patient’s status.  
**Message:** [Lactating.\|Pregnancy risk high.\|Pregnant.\|Pregnancy desired.] [Imaging agent ordered.\|Potentially harmful medication.\|Imaging test ordered.] [Counsel about express/discard milk.\|Counsel risk/benefit.]

**Trigger:** A laboratory test is resulted or an ICD code is added to an encounter, the PTF file or the Problem List that indicates a pregnancy status that is different from the status documented in the Women’s Health package.  
**Mechanism:** Protocols are added or extended between the Clinical Reminders package and the Laboratory, Patient Care Encounter, Problem List and Registration packages. When a protocol message contains a code or a laboratory test of interest (as determined by terms and taxonomies), the Clinical Reminders package executes a computed finding that retrieves the patient’s current pregnancy status. The status is then compared with the term or taxonomy that contains the code to determine if a conflict exists.

### Lab Result Notifications

OE/RR 2.5 lab result notifications/alerts were modified to fit into the CPRS scheme. CPRS exports seven lab result-related notifications:

**Lab Results** follow-up action displays all results for that order  
**Abnormal Lab Results (Action)** follow-up action displays all results for that order  
**Abnormal Lab Result (Info)** information only, results and collection date/time in alert msg  
**Critical Lab Results (Action)** follow-up action displays all results for that order  
**Critical Lab Result (Info)** information only, results and collection date/time in alert msg  
**Lab Threshold Exceeded** follow-up action displays all results for that order, including results that exceeded the threshold.  
**STAT Lab Results** follow-up action displays all results for that order  
If the parameter controlling notification recipients (ORB PROCESSING FLAG), is set up improperly, it is possible for a user to receive six different alerts for one lab order (they will get Lab Results when it is resulted, Abnormal Lab Results (Action) and Abnormal Lab Result (Info) if the result is 'H' or 'L', Critical Lab Results (Action) and Critical Lab Result (Info) if the result is 'HH' or 'LL', and STAT Lab Results if the urgency for the order was STAT. [Clue: To review how a user is set up to receive notifications/alerts, use the Notifications Mgmt menu option ‘Display the Notifications a User Can Receive’] For example, if a Chem 7 has three abnormal results, users with Abnormal Lab Results (Action) as ‘Mandatory’ will get one alert for the Chem 7. The alert’s follow-up action will display all results for the Chem 7. Users with Abnormal Lab Result (Info) as ‘Mandatory’ will get three “Information” alerts. The abnormal values and collection date/times will be in the alert message. A similar scenario exists for the two Critical Lab Result(s) notifications. In most cases, users should NOT have Lab Results and either Abnormal Lab Result(s) notification set to ‘Mandatory.’

**☞ NOTE:  If any notification is set to ‘Mandatory’ for the user’s Team, user’s Service, patient’s Location, site’s Division, or site’s System, the user will get the notification. With the exception where the patient’s Location (inpatient only) is set to ‘Disabled’. All instances of the notification for patients in that location will be ‘Disabled’ and not processed. Whereas the notification for patients in other hospital locations will be processed as ‘Mandatory’. This feature of CPRS was specifically included to reduce the number of abnormal and critical lab alerts for patients in critical care units like ICU. Patient location notifications are disabled via the Enable/Disable Notifications option then selecting 'Location' and the notification. This option is only available on ORMGR and clinical coordinator menus.**  
To prevent multiple lab alert problems, the following setups are recommended:

• Users who want to see ALL lab results (some users process all lab alerts as part of their job), should set the Lab Results notification to ‘Mandatory’. ‘Disable’ the other lab results notifications for the user.  
• Providers who do not want to get all lab result alerts may find it best to set Abnormal Lab Results (Action) and Critical Lab Result (Info) to ‘Mandatory’. There may be some duplication at times but the docs will be alerted to critical labs and also be able to review Abnormal Labs when desired. STAT Lab Results may also be a notification they wish to set to ‘Mandatory’, depending on how they plan to use the notifications/alerts to follow-up lab orders. Also, set Abnormal Lab Results (Info) and Critical Lab Results (Action) to ‘Disabled.’  
**☞ NOTE: If any notification is set to ‘Mandatory’ for the user’s Team, user’s Service, patient’s Location, site’s Division, or site’s System, the user will get the notification.**  
• Other providers will wish to get only information alerts with no follow-up action. For these users, set Abnormal Lab Result (Info) and Critical Lab Result (Info) to ‘Mandatory’ and the other three lab result notifications to ‘Disabled’. (They may want to set the STAT Lab Results to ‘Mandatory.’)  
• Some providers may want to set Critical Lab Results (Action) or (Info) to ‘Mandatory’ and ‘Disable’ all other lab result notifications.  
### Forwarding Alerts to Supervisors/Surrogates

The forwarding of alerts to supervisors and surrogates works as follows:  
1\. Identify the number of days you want an alert to be held before it is sent to the user's supervisor and/or MailMan surrogate(s). (Supervisor is determined by Kernel to be the service chief of the user’s service section.) This number of days value is set in the Notification Mgmt Menu options.  
2\. When the alert/notification is triggered, the number of days values for forwarding to supervisor and/or surrogate are sent with the alert to the Kernel Alert utility.  
3\. Whenever the option XQALERT DELETE OLD is triggered, alerts older than 14 days are deleted. In addition, the algorithm searches for alerts with the forward to surrogate/supervisor number of days values greater than zero. If forwarding values are found and the recipient has not responded to the alert within the set number of days, it is forwarded to the recipient's supervisor and/or mailman surrogates.  
4\. If forwarding is to occur with regularity, the option XQALERT DELETE OLD must be triggered regularly. Most often this is accomplished via TaskMan. Because this option also cleans up old alerts (the archives are still kept) it should be run daily/nightly. If you want forwarding to surrogates and supervisors to occur, the XQALERT DELETE OLD option must be queued to run regularly.  
5\. No mail message or bulletin is sent to the surrogate(s) or supervisor. The alert is “forwarded” to the surrogate(s) and/or supervisor. The alert will be similar to those noted below.  
**Example of Forwarded Alerts**  
1\. CPRSPATIENT,ONE (C0005): New order(s) placed.  
Forwarded by: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN Generated: 07/00/97 16:26:36  
ALERT NOT PROCESSED BY CPRSPROVIDER,TEN  
2\. CPRSPATIENT,FOUR (C0004): New order(s) placed.  
Forwarded by: CPRSPROVIDER,TEN Generated: 07/00/97 14:40:32  
ALERT NOT PROCESSED BY CPRSPROVIDER,TEN  
#### Parameter Descriptions

##### ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR: Hold Days before Forward to Supervisor

This parameter is the number of days before a notification is forwarded to a recipient's supervisor. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicted or zero, the notification will not be forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of 14 for this parameter, it will be forwarded to the supervisor of each recipient who hasn't processed the notification after 14 days. Determination of recipients who have not processed the notification/alert is made when the option XQALERT DELETE OLD is processed. Supervisors are determined by the Kernel Alert Utility to be the user’s service/section chief. Alerts are not forwarded to supervisors of recipients who have processed the alert within 14 days or who have processed the alert within the number of days identified in the parameter. If the value of this parameter is zero or non-existent, the alert/notification is never forwarded.

##### ORB FORWARD SURROGATES: Hold Days before Forward to Surrogates

This parameter is the number of days before a notification is forwarded to a recipient's surrogates. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification will not be forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of 14 for this parameter, it will be forwarded to the surrogates of each recipient who haven't processed the notification after 14 days. Determination of recipients who have not processed the notification/alert is made when the option XQALERT DELETE OLD is processed. Surrogates are determined by the Kernel Alert Utility to be the user’s MailMan surrogates. Alerts are not forwarded to surrogates of recipients who have processed the alert within 14 days or who have processed the alert within the number of days identified in the parameter. If the value of this parameter is zero or non-existent, the alert/notification is never forwarded.

### Debugging Time-Driven Notifications

Usually the reason time-driven alerts are not triggering is the national term is not mapped and/or the expiring or unverified orders do not exist within the correct time range with the correct order status. Here are some useful steps in troubleshooting time-driven notifications/alerts.

1\. Review the mechanism and logic for the notification in the notification description above. Make sure all mapping (if appropriate) is complete and accurate.  
2\. Check to make sure the notification system is enabled:  
W \$\$GET\^XPAR("SYS\^PKG","ORB SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE",1,"I")  
It should return an "E".  
3\. Check the last time the process was queued:  
W \$\$GET\^XPAR("SYS","ORB LAST QUEUE DATE",1,"I")  
**☞ HINT: You can use \^XPAREDIT to change this value back to an earlier date time so you will process a wider date/time range. Otherwise it only looks at orders since the last time the process was queued.**  
4\. For Unverified Order notifications, check to see how long an order had to go unverified before it would trigger the alert (the delay period):  
W \$\$GET\^XPAR("ALL","ORB UNVERIFIED ORDER",1,"I")  
Also, this notification will not be present for orders older than 30 days or from a previous admission.  
**☞ HINT: You can use Notification mgmt options or \^XPAREDIT to modify this value to be 0 (zero) hours so you can place an order then run the time-driven alerts code. You can also run the code directly via TNOTIFS\^ORB3TIM1 and bypass ORMTIME. The code looks for unverified orders between the last queue date/time and the delay date/time. The exceptions can be found in the notification’s description. (Order status, outpatient order, etc.) Finally, EN\^ORB3 is called to determine recipients and send the alert.**  
5\. For DNR Expiring notifications, check to see if the DNR term has been mapped properly:  
W \$\$TERMLKUP\^ORB31(.ORBY,"DNR")  
The function should return "101.43", with ORBY equal to something like "ORBY(1)=2581\^Do Not Resuscitate". (101.43 is the Orderable Item file.) Orders with a status noted in the notification’s description or for a deceased patient are screened out. Finally, check to see if the orderable item of the expiring order is the same as the orderable item for the mapped DNR term:  
W \$\$OI\^ORQOR2(\<expiring order number\>)  
If the returned orderable item equals the mapped DNR term’s orderable item, EN\^ORB3 is called to determine recipients and send the alert.  
Remember, you can trigger time-driven notifications/alerts directly via TNOTIFS\^ORB3TIM1 and bypass ORMTIME.

*Refer to “Notification Algorithm for Processing Potential Recipients” document for more information.*  
###

### Notification Algorithm for Processing Potential Recipients

Each user on the potential recipient list is evaluated according to values set for entities identified in the parameter ORB PROCESSING FLAG. The parameter’s entity values are processed in the following order to determine if that particular user should receive the notification/alert or not. If a user on the recipient list has the notification “ON” (they will receive the alert). If the user has a Kernel Alert surrogate, the surrogate will receive the alert. The original user will not receive the alert if he has a surrogate!

**☞ NOTE: You can access these entity values via options “Enable/Disable Notifications” and “Display the Notifications a User Can Receive.”**  
**The first condition met below stops the processing and determines whether or not the user will receive the notification/alert.** Processing order:  
a. If the USER’s value for the notification is Mandatory or Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
b. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
c. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
d. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
e. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Mandatory, the user will receive the alert.  
f. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
g. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Mandatory (and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION has no value), the user will receive the alert.  
h. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Mandatory (and DIVISION and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION have no value), the user will receive the alert.  
i. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Mandatory (and SYSTEM, DIVISION\*, and PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION have no value), the user will receive the alert.  
j. If the USER’s value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
k. If the user’s TEAM value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
l. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
m. If the user’s SERVICE/SECTION value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
n. If the PATIENT’s HOSPITAL LOCATION (inpatients only) value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
o. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
p. If the user’s DIVISION\* value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
q. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
r. If the SYSTEM value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
s. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Disabled, the user will NOT receive the alert.  
t. If the PACKAGE (OERR-exported) value for the notification is Enabled, the user will receive the alert.  
u. If none of the above parameter values are found, the notification is processed as Disabled and the user will NOT receive the alert.  
**☞ NOTE: All notifications will have a value (Enabled, Disabled or Mandatory), at the package level when exported.**  
**☞ NOTE: \* If the user has multiple divisions, the first division found with a “Mandatory” value is used. If no mandatory division values exist and a division has an “Enabled” value, that division is used. If neither mandatory nor enabled division values exist and a division has a “Disabled” value, that division is used.**  
### Using Kernel Alert Option XQALERT DELETE OLD

The Kernel Alert option XQALERT DELETE OLD is used to perform several alert clean-up and management jobs. These jobs include:

1\. Delete alerts unprocessed after 14 days (unless a different time period is specified).  
2\. Purge alerts from the Alert Tracking file.  
3\. Forward alerts to supervisors.  
1.  Forward alerts to MailMan surrogates.  
1.  Forward alerts to Backup Reviewers.  
The option XQALERT DELETE OLD can be run directly or as a queued job. As a queued job, the option should be setup to run through TaskMan on a regular basis, preferably once per day. This is accomplished by adding XQALERT DELETE OLD as an entry in the OPTION SCHEDULING file.

#### Delete Alerts Unprocessed after a Number of Days

All alerts unprocessed after a specified number of days are deleted and will no longer appear on the “View Alerts” display. The default number of days is 14. However, the number of days can be set as described in the note below. The date/time of deletion by this method is noted in the “Auto deleted:” field of the Alert Tracking file.  
**Note:** If the alerts are deleted at the default 14 days, the alerts will continue to be stored in the Alert Tracking file for another 16 days. (Unless specified otherwise, alerts are deleted from the Alert Tracking file after 30 days.)  
**Note:** The 14 days retention period before deletion is a default value. This value can be changed through the TASK PARAMETERS field of the OPTION SCHEDULING file. A numeric value in the TASK PARAMETERS field will replace the default alert retention value of 14 days.  
##### Purge Alerts from the Alert Tracking File

XQALERT DELETE OLD purges all alerts older than 30 days from the Alert Tracking file. If the alert also exists in the Alert file, it is deleted from there as well. The 30 day default value can be modified by using the Notification Mgmt option “9 Archive (delete) after \<x\> Days” (option ORB3 ARCHIVE PERIOD) to enter a value for parameter ORB ARCHIVE PERIOD. This value is delivered with the alert to Kernel and calculates a value for the RETENTION DATE field of the Alert Tracking file. Purging alerts from the alerts files is especially useful to sites with a high volume of alerts in that it saves disk space and response time.

##### Forward Alerts to Supervisors

Alerts unprocessed after a specified period are forwarded to the alert recipient’s supervisor (service/section chief.) If no forwarding value exists, the alert is not forwarded. The forwarding value can be set by using Notification Mgmt option “10 Forward Notifications ...” then selection “1 Forward Unprocessed Notification to Supervisor” (option ORB3 FORWARD SUPERVISOR), to enter a value for parameter ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR.

##### Forward Alerts to MailMan Surrogates

Alerts unprocessed after a specified period are forwarded to the alert recipient’s MailMan surrogates.

If no forwarding value exists, the alert is not forwarded. The forwarding value can be set by using Notification Mgmt option “10 Forward Notifications ...” then selection “2 Forward Unprocessed Notification to Surrogates” (option ORB3 FORWARD SURROGATES), to enter a value for parameter ORB FORWARD SURROGATES.

**Example of a Forwarded Alert**  
1\. CPRSPATIENT,TWO (C0002): New order(s) placed.  
Forwarded by: CPRSPROVIDER,SIX Generated: 07/02/00 16:26:36  
ALERT NOT PROCESSED BY CPRSPROVIDER,SIX  
##### Forward Alerts to Backup Reviewers

Alerts unprocessed after a specified period are forwarded to the Backup Reviewer as designated by the ALERT BACKUP REVIEWER parameter. If no forwarding value exists, the alert is not forwarded. The forwarding value, which is the number of days the user has to respond to the alert. After the forwarding value, or number of days elapses, CPRS forwards the alert to another reviewer. You can enter a forwarding value for parameter ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER using Notification Mgmt option “10 Forward Notifications ...” then selection “3 Forward Unprocessed Notification to Bkup Reviewer” (option ORB3 FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER). The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification will not be forwarded. The Backup Reviewer, the individual who will receive the alert, can be set via the option “Set Backup Reviewer for Alerts” (XQAL SET BACKUP REVIEWER) on the Alert Management (XQALERT MGR) menu.

For example, if you set the ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER parameter to 14, the alert will be forwarded to the backup reviewer of each recipient who hasn't processed the notification after 14 days. The Kernel Alert Utility determines which recipients have not processed their alerts in the specified time and who the backup reviewer for each recipient is.

**How to Enable, Disable, or set a Notification as Mandatory**  
This section explains how to enable, disable, or set a notification as mandatory. Sites should use caution when enabling, disabling, or setting a notification to mandatory. Sites must do their best to provide the right level of information for providers. Providers can receive numerous notifications, to the point where they begin to feel that responding to notifications is all they do.  
However, notifications and the timely actions they require or information they convey can help providers better serve their patients.  
There are two options to enable/disable or set notifications as mandatory.  
The first example allows for selection of one user and one notification to enable, disable, or set as mandatory. The second example allows for selection of one or more users and one or more notifications to enable, disable, or set as mandatory.  
1.  **Use the following steps to enable, disable, or set a notification as mandatory for one user and one notification in CPRS:**  
1.  In the List Manager interface, choose the ORMGR CPRS Manager menu.  
1.  Select the PE CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) option.  
1.  Select the NO Notification Mgmt Menu option.  
1.  Select Enable/Disable Notifications option.

## Appendix D: Notification Parameters in CPRS 1 – Technical Overview

### Introduction

CPRS Notifications uses the Parameter file [\#8989.5] to export values for parameters that determine how notifications are processed. Some of these parameters replaced fields in the Notifications file [\#100.9]; others are new in CPRS. When each parameter is defined and set up via the Parameter Definition file [\#8989.51], a set of entity relationships is established. Most CPRS Notification parameters were set up with links to the “Package” entity. Hence, the exported notification “defaults” are found as parameter values for package entity “Order Entry/Results Reporting.” Notification parameter values for package entities (Order Entry/Results Reporting) should never be modified. Changes specific to your site can be made for system, division, and other entities depending on how each parameter is defined. (Refer to CPRS Install documents for a listing of exported default values.)  
**☞ NOTE: Some parameters have a “Location” entity type. Only inpatient location entities are used. Outpatient location entities are ignored because a patient’s outpatient location cannot be reliably determined and a patient can have several simultaneous outpatient locations.**  
### Parameters

**ORB ARCHIVE PERIOD [Option: ORB3 ARCHIVE PERIOD]**  
This parameter indicates the number of days to archive a notification in the Alert Tracking file [\#8992.1]. If not indicated, the default period of 30 days is used. The maximum number of days is 100,000 or about 220 years. When a notification/alert is triggered, this value is passed to the Kernel Alert Utility. Kernel Alerts stores the value with each individual alert in the Alert Tracking File [\^XTV(8992.1]. The Kernel Alert Utility handles the actual display, archiving, and deletion of alerts.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestion:

• If you wish to keep alerts for a notification as long as possible, set this value to its maximum of 100,000 (about 220 years.)  
***

**ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES [Option: ORB3 DEFAULT DEVICE RECIPIENTS]**  
This parameter sets devices as default recipients of a notification, regardless of patient. A value of “Yes” indicates the device always receives the notification when it is triggered. Example devices include printers, terminals, and files.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Set a file to receive every instance of a notification useful in meeting JCAHO requirements.  
• Troubleshoot notification occurrences by sending them to a printer or a file.  
• Set a file to receive every instance of a notification for research purposes. Later parse the file removing key data for use in a spreadsheet or research database.  
**ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS [Option: ORB3 DEFAULT RECIPIENTS]**  
This parameter sets teams and/or users as default recipients of a notification, regardless of patient. A value of “Yes” indicates the team/user always receives the notification when it is triggered – despite values in the ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Set up a dietician team to receive all instances of the Food/Drug Interaction alert by using this parameter to set that team as a “Default Recipient” for the Food/Drug Interaction notification.  
**☞ NOTE: Do not add patients to these teams. If patients exist on these teams, the dieticians will also receive alerts for notifications with an ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENT value containing “T”. To prevent dieticians on this team from receiving unwanted alerts, set the team’s ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter values to Disabled for all Mandatory notifications. (With patch OR\*3\*74, Disabled Team values take precedence over Mandatory values at all entity levels except User.)**  
• Set up a QA team to receive all instances of a notification.  
**ORB DELETE MECHANISM [Option: ORB3 DELETE MECHANISM]**  
This parameter determines how alerts are deleted when a successful alert follow-up action is taken or a user views an “Information Only” alert. It is a set of codes including:  
• **I** (Individual Recipient): delete the notification for an individual recipient when:  
• That individual completes the follow-up action on notifications with associated follow-up action.  
• That individual reviews notifications without follow-up actions.  
• **A** (All Recipients): delete the notification for all recipients when:  
• Any recipient completes the follow-up action on notifications with follow-up actions.  
• Any recipient reviews notifications without follow-up actions.  
***

ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**ORB FLAGGED ORDERS BULLETIN [Option: ORB3 FLAGGED ORDERS BULLETIN]**  
This parameter is used to determine if a bulletin should be sent when an order is “flagged for clarification.” A “Yes” indicates a MailMan bulletin is sent to the order’s Current Provider (usually the Ordering Provider) when the order is flagged. This option has no effect on the Flagged Order for Clarification notification that is also triggered when an order is flagged for clarification.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Service  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 4 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestion:

• If you have a service that prefers bulletins over notifications/alerts when an order is flagged, set this parameter to “Yes” for the service and “Disable” the notification “Flagged Order for Clarification” for the service via the ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter. Furthermore, if you have a user within that service who prefers notifications/alerts over bulletins when an order is flagged, set this parameter to “No” for the user and set the user’s processing flag value for the notification “Flagged Order for Clarification” to be “Mandatory.”  
**ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER [Option: ORB3 FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER]**  
This new parameter supports Kernel Alert functionality that allows users to identify a user (backup reviewer) to receive unattended alerts after x days. The new parameter indicates how many days to wait before forwarding an alert to the backup reviewer. (Specifying a user's backup reviewer is accomplished via Kernel Alert option XQAL SET BACKUP REVIEWER.) This is similar to current functionality that forwards alerts to a user's surrogate or supervisor. The value exported with this patch for each OE/RR notification/alert on your system is 0 (zero.) A zero indicates the notification/alert will never be forwarded to the backup reviewer. This new parameter does not affect TIU and non-OE/RR alerts.  
**Note:** You must change the parameter value for each notification/alert your site intends to be forwarded to the backup reviewer.  
***

ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
***

**ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR [Option: ORB3 FORWARD SUPERVISOR]**  
This parameter indicates how many days to hold an unprocessed alert before forwarding it to the user’s supervisor. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification is never forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of “14” for this parameter, it is forwarded to the supervisor of each recipient who hasn’t processed the notification within 14 days. Determination of recipients who have not processed the notification and their supervisors is made by the Kernel Alert Utility. For this purpose, Kernel Alerts recognizes the user’s service/section chief as supervisor.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**ORB FORWARD SURROGATES [Option: ORB3 FORWARD SURROGATES]**  
This parameter indicates how many days to hold an unprocessed alert before forwarding it to the user’s MailMan surrogates. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification is never forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of 14 for this parameter, it is forwarded to the MailMan surrogates of each recipient who hasn’t processed the notification within 14 days. Determination of recipients who have not processed the notification and their surrogates is made by the Kernel Alert Utility.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**ORB LAST QUEUE DATE [Option: No User Interaction]**  
This parameter indicates the last date/time the Driven-driven notifications were triggered.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestion:

• Do not modify this parameter unless you desire an unrelenting hail of expiring order alerts and riotous user behavior.  
**ORB OI EXPIRING – INPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter is used to trigger the FLAGGED OI EXPIRING - INPT notification/alert when a specific orderable item is expiring for an inpatient. For this notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the order’s orderable item and the patient must be an inpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL inpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Flag orderable items for restraints/protective devices that need to be renewed every 24 hours.  
• Flag orderable items of importance to JCAHO.  
• Flag orderable items for telemetry orders.  
• Send an alert to a printer whenever a particular orderable item is ordered.  
**ORB OI EXPIRING – OUTPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter is used to trigger the FLAGGED OI EXPIRING - OUTPT notification/alert when a specific orderable item is expiring for an outpatient. For the notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the order’s orderable item and the patient must be an outpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL inpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Flag orderable items for HBHC orders.  
• Flag orderable items of importance to JCAHO.  
• Send an alert to a printer whenever a particular orderable item is ordered.  
**ORB OI ORDERED – INPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter identifies or “flags” an orderable item to trigger the FLAGGED OI ORDER - INPT notification/alert when the orderable item is ordered for an inpatient. For the notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the order’s orderable item and the patient must be an inpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL inpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• If an infection control officer wants to receive an alert any time a special antibiotic is ordered, identify that user as the entity, then select the antibiotic’s orderable item. (The orderable item must be linked with applicable order dialogs.)  
• Alert the chief of radiology whenever a particularly expensive imaging procedure is ordered.  
• Alert a QA team whenever special lab tests are ordered.  
• Send an alert to a printer whenever a particular orderable item is ordered.  
**ORB OI ORDERED – OUTPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter identifies or “flags” an orderable item to trigger the FLAGGED OI ORDER - OUTPT notification/alert when the orderable item is ordered for an outpatient. For the notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the order’s orderable item and the patient must be an outpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL outpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Alert a clinician whenever a particular orderable item is ordered for patients on his team.  
• Send an alert to a printer whenever a particular orderable item is ordered.  
**ORB OI RESULTS – INPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter identifies or “flags” an orderable item to trigger the FLAGGED OI RESULTS - INPT notification/alert when a related order is resulted for an inpatient. This only works for results-based orderable items (Lab, Imaging, and Consults.) For the notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the related order’s orderable item and the patient must be an inpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL outpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• If an infection control officer wants to receive an alert any time a particular lab procedure is resulted, identify that user as the entity then select the procedure’s orderable item. (The orderable item must be linked with applicable order dialogs.)  
• Send an alert to a file whenever a particular orderable item is resulted.  
**ORB OI RESULTS – OUTPT [Option: ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**  
This parameter identifies or “flags” an orderable item to trigger the FLAGGED OI RESULTS - OUTPT notification/alert when a related order is resulted for an outpatient. This only works for results-based orderable items (Lab, Imaging, and Consults.) For the notification to be triggered, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match the related order’s orderable item and the patient must be an outpatient. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. OE/RR Teams, individual users or devices can be set up to receive the alert for one or more orderable items by selecting the desired team, user or device via this parameter. If the value for the orderable item flag is "YES", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item becomes a potential alert recipient for ALL outpatients. (If a device is added to the potential recipient list, it will always receive the alert.) If the value is "NO", the entity (user, team, device), flagging the orderable item only becomes a potential alert recipient if that entity is "linked" to the patient. Users are linked to a patient if the user is the patient's attending physician, primary inpatient provider, PCMM primary care practitioner or PCMM associate provider. In addition, users are linked to a patient if the user shares an OE/RR team with the patient or holds a team position assignment on the patient’s primary PCMM team. OE/RR teams are linked to a patient if the patient is on the OE/RR team. (If a patient is on an OE/RR team that has flagged an orderable item, all users on that team become potential alert recipients.) Devices (printers, etc.) are linked to a patient if the device and patient are on the same OE/RR team.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Device  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Alert a clinician whenever a particular orderable item is resulted for patients on his team.  
• Send an alert to a file whenever a particular orderable item is resulted.  
**ORB PROCESSING FLAG [Option: ORB3 PROCESSING FLAG]**  
This parameter determines notification/alert recipients. It replaces the Notifications file Processing Flag field. Whereas the field contained the set of codes “D”isabled, “E”nabled, “M”andatory, and “N”avigation, the parameter contains “E”nabled, “D”isabled and “M”andatory. Unlike most parameters, ORB PROCESSING FLAG is not used to determine an overall value based on Entity Precedence. Instead, a Notifications algorithm obtains the ORB PROCESSING FLAG value for all entity levels when determining alert recipients. (Refer to Notifications documents for a detailed explanation of this process.)  
**☞ NOTE: If a team’s or user’s ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENTS parameter value for a notification is ‘’True,” that Team or User will always receive that notification/alert, regardless of any ORB PROCESSING FLAG value. This is also true for devices identified via the ORB DEFAULT RECIPIENT DEVICES parameter.**  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Team (OE/RR)  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Service  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 4 ENTITY TYPE: Location  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 5 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 6 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestions:

• Disable Critical Lab Result alerts for ICU patients by setting the ICU (Location entity), value of this parameter to “Disabled” for the Critical Lab Results notifications. (For this parameter, Location entity values take precedence over Division and System entity values, even if those values are “Mandatory.”) If a critical lab result now occurs for a patient in ICU, the alert will not be triggered. Critical Lab Result alerts continue to be possible for patients in other locations.  
• To send only one particular notification/alert (and no others) to an OE/RR team, set the team’s parameter value to Mandatory for that notification and all set other team notification parameter values to Disabled. If a user on the team wants to receive additional notifications/alerts, the user can set his parameter value to Enabled or Mandatory for each desired notification.  
**ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS [Option: ORB3 PROVIDER RECIPIENTS]**  
This parameter determines if the ordering provider, attending physician, inpatient primary provider, OE/RR patient-related teams, PCMM teams, PCMM primary care practitioner, PCMM associate provider or user entering the order are considered for potential alert recipients. This parameter replaces the Recipient Restrictions, Exclude Attending and Exclude Primary fields in the Notifications file and the Notification to Physician field in the Order Parameter file. The value for this parameter can be any one or combination of the codes listed below. These codes indicate a site’s preferred notification recipients by the user title or relationship to the patient. The codes include:  
**P** (Primary Provider): deliver notification to the patient's (inpatient) Primary Provider.  
**A** (Attending Physician): deliver notification to the patient's Attending Physician.  
**T** (Patient Care Teams): deliver notification to the patient's OE/RR Teams (personal patient and team lists are evaluated for potential recipients) and to devices on an OE/RR team.  
**O** (Ordering Provider): deliver notification to the provider who placed/requested the order (if the notification is order-based.)  
**M** (PCMM Team): deliver notification to the users/providers linked to the patient via PCMM Team Position assignments.  
**E** (Entering User): deliver notification to the user/provider who entered the order’s most recent activity.  
**R** (PCMM PCP): deliver notification to the patient’s PCMM Primary Care Practitioner (PCP).  
**S** (PCMM Assoc Prov.): deliver notification to the patient’s PCMM Associate Provider.  
***

**C** (PCMM Mental Health  
Treatment Coordinator): deliver notification to the patient's PCMM Mental Health Treatment Coordinator.  
**☞ NOTE: The providers, physicians, and teams must be set up properly and accurately for correct recipient determination.**  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
##### Customization Suggestion:

• Create teams for inpatient nurses and/or clerks to receive an alert when new orders are placed on patients in their ward. When creating the team, set up an auto link to the desired ward(s). This will automatically add and remove patients to the team when they are admitted, transferred or discharged. Next, set this parameter to “T” for the New Order notification to indicate the alert should only go to teams. (Most attendings, primary providers, and ordering providers will not want to receive an alert every time one of their patients has a new order placed.) [Please remember a “T” indicates all team and personal lists that include the patient will be evaluated for potential alert recipients.]  
Next, use the parameter ORB PROCESSING FLAG to set the value for the New Order notification to “Disabled” for your System or Division. (Disabling the notification for the System/Division will prevent most teams, personal lists and users from receiving the alert.  
Finally, use the ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter to set the New Order notification value to “Mandatory” or “Enabled” for the teams you created. (A setting of “Enabled” will allow users on the team to disable the notification/alert if desired whereas “Mandatory” will send the alert to all users on that team.)  
**ORB SORT METHOD [Option: ORB3 SORT METHOD]**  
This parameter determines how notifications are sorted in the GUI display. Possibilities include:  
**P**: Patient: sort by patient name.  
**T**: Type: sort by notification type (Name field in file 100.9.)  
**U**: Urgency: sort by notification’s value in the ORB URGENCY parameter.  
Within these sort methods notifications are presented in reverse chronological order.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: User  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**ORB SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE [Option: ORB3 SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE]**  
This parameter determines if any CPRS Notification processing will occur. In effect, it enables or disables all notification processing.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**☞ NOTE: This parameter disables all types of notifications. Additional functionality exists in the CPRS Expert System to inactivate specific rule-based notifications.**  
**ORB URGENCY [Option: ORB3 URGENCY]**  
The ORB URGENCY parameter is used in the GUI display. If an entity’s ORB SORT METHOD parameter value is set to “Urgency,” notifications displayed in the GUI are sorted by their value in this parameter. Possible values include:

**ORBC CONVERSION [Option: No User Interaction]**  
This parameter indicates whether or not the notification conversion from OE/RR 2.5 has occurred. It prevents overwriting of existing parameter values if CPRS must be installed multiple times.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**☞ NOTE: Do not modify this parameter – unless, of course, you desire a maelstrom of user discontent.**  
**ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE [Option: No User Interaction]**  
This parameter sets the Pharmacy order urgency replacement for “ASAP” if a site does not use the exact order urgency name “ASAP” in the Order Urgency file (\#101.42). This parameter is delivered blank; if the installation software does not detect the order urgency “ASAP” in the Order Urgency file, then the installer is asked to designate an alternative from existing entries in the file.  
If a site decides to make any modification to the order urgency entry “ASAP” after installation of patch OR\*3.0\*435, then this parameter must be edited to specify the replacement for “ASAP.” Using the [General Parameter Tools](#206ipza) [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, select the Edit Parameter Values [XPAR EDIT PARAMETER] option, and then modify the ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE parameter to use an alternative to “ASAP” from entries present in the Order Urgency file.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**☞NOTE: If a site renames the order urgency “ASAP” and this parameter is not set, then Pharmacy orders from CPRS might fail.**

## Appendix E: Exported (Default) Values for Notification Parameters

### Introduction

CPRS Notifications use the Parameter file [\#8989.5] to export values for parameters that determine how notifications will be processed. Some of these parameters replaced fields in the Notifications file [\#100.9]; others are new in CPRS. When each parameter is defined and set up via the Parameter Definition file [\#8989.51], a set of entity relationships is established. Most CPRS Notification parameters were set up with links to the “Package” entity in order to export default values with CPRS. Hence, the exported notification “defaults” are found as parameter values for package entity “Order Entry/Results Reporting.” Notification parameter values for package entities (Order Entry/Results Reporting) should never be modified. Changes specific to your site can be made for system, division, and other entities depending on how each parameter is defined. (For additional information regarding notification parameters, refer to the Parameters documents.)  
### Overview

The **ORB ARCHIVE PERIOD** parameter indicates the number of days to archive the notification in the Alert Tracking file [\#8992.1]. CPRS exports a value of “30” days for all notifications to indicate all alerts derived from OE/RR Notifications will be deleted after 30 days.  
The **ORB DELETE MECHANISM** parameter is used to determine how alerts are deleted when a successful alert follow-up action is taken or a user views an “Information Only” alert. The exported default value for the Notifications Expert Panel determined each notification and test site experience.  
The **ORB ERASE ALL** parameter is used to indicate if a user will have access to an option that allows the user to delete alerts. A value of “Yes” indicates that the user can delete all of the user’s alerts. This parameter will become available with Patch OR\*3\*85.  
The **ORB FLAGGED ORDERS BULLETIN** parameter is used to determine if a bulletin should be sent when an order is flagged. The exported default value is “No,” the bulletin will not be sent.  
The **ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR** parameter indicates how many days to hold an unprocessed alert before forwarding it to the user’s service/section supervisor. The exported value for all notifications is “0” days, indicating the related alerts will never be forwarded.  
The **ORB FORWARD SURROGATES** parameter indicates how many days to hold an unprocessed alert before forwarding it to the user’s MailMan surrogates. The exported value for all notifications is “0” days, indicating the related alerts will never be forwarded.  
The **ORB PROCESSING FLAG** parameter determines notification/alert recipients. It replaces the Processing Flag field in the Notifications file. Whereas the field contained the set of codes “D” for Disabled, “E” for Enabled, “M” for Mandatory, and “N” Navigation, the parameter only contains “D” for Disabled and “M” for Mandatory. The exported values for all notifications new in CPRS are “D” for Disabled. Experience has shown that bringing these notifications gradually online is better than flooding users with new alerts right after CPRS is installed. Several different entity relationships exist for this parameter enabling sites to selectively “turn on” the new notifications. Exported values for “Mandatory” OE/RR 2.5 notifications remain “Mandatory.” “Enabled” OE/RR 2.5 notifications are exported without any value for this parameter. (Refer to the Parameters documents for additional information.)  
The **ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS** parameter determines if the ordering provider, attending physician, primary provider, or patient-related teams will be considered for potential alert recipients. This parameter replaces the Recipient Restrictions, Exclude Attending, and Exclude Primary fields in the Notifications file and the Notification to Physician field in the Order Parameter file. The Notifications Expert Panel and test site experience determined the exported value for each notification.  
The **ORB SORT METHOD** is used to determine how notifications will be sorted in the GUI display. The exported value is “Type” indicating notifications will be sorted by notification.  
The **ORB SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE** parameter determines if any CPRS Notification processing will occur. In effect, it enables or disables all notification processing. The exported default value is “Disabled” – no notifications will be processed, no OE/RR alerts will be delivered. (The default value is “Disabled” to speed-up conversions during CPRS installation.) Sites are encouraged to “Enable” this parameter at the System or Division entity as soon as possible after CPRS installation. (It is NOT necessary to wait until all CPRS conversions have completed.) Once this parameter is enabled, OE/RR 2.5 notifications/alerts will resume. However, new CPRS notifications will remain disabled until enabled (set to “Mandatory” at one or more entities), via the ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter.  
The **ORB UNVERIFIED MED ORDER** parameter sets the number of hours delay after a medication order has been placed before triggering the notification/alert Unverified Medication Order. The exported value is “2” hours - if a medication order has not been verified by a nurse within two hours after the order was placed, the notification is triggered and an alert is sent. Sites can modify this value at the System or Division entity.  
The **ORB UNVERIFIED ORDER** parameter sets the number of hours delay after an order has been placed before triggering the notification/alert Unverified Order. The exported value is “2” hours - if an order has not been verified by a nurse within two hours after the order was placed, the notification is triggered and an alert is sent. Sites can modify this value at the System or Division entity.  
The **ORB URGENCY** parameter is used in the GUI display. If an entity’s ORB SORT METHOD parameter value is set to “Urgency,” notifications displayed in the GUI are sorted by their value in this parameter. The Notification Expert Panel determined the exported default value for each notification.  
Additional CPRS Notification parameters exist that do not have exported default values. These are discussed in the Parameters documents. A list of CPRS Notification parameters with exported default values follows.

## Appendix F: Order Check

### Order Check Parameters in CPRS 1 - Technical Overview

#### Introduction

CPRS Order Checks use the Parameter file [\#8989.5] to export values for parameters that determine how order checks are processed. All of these parameters are new in CPRS. When each parameter is defined and set up via the Parameter Definition file [\#8989.51], a set of entity relationships is established. Most CPRS Order Check parameters were set up with links to the “Package” entity in order to export default values with CPRS. Hence, the exported order checking “defaults” are parameter values for package entity “Order Entry/Results Reporting.” Order Check parameter values for package entities (Order Entry/Results Reporting) should never be modified. Changes specific to your site can be made for system, division, and other entities, depending on how each parameter is defined. (Refer to CPRS Install documents for a listing of exported default values.)

**☞ NOTE: Some parameters have a “Location” entity type. Only inpatient location entities are used. Outpatient location entities are ignored because a patient’s outpatient location cannot be reliably determined and a patient can have several simultaneous outpatient locations.**  
#### Parameters

**ORK CLINICAL DANGER LEVEL [Option: ORK CLINICAL DANGER LEVEL]**  
This parameter indicates an order check’s potential clinical danger to the patient. Potential values are a set of codes:

1.  (High): Order check indicates a potentially high danger to the patient.  
1.  (Moderate): Order check indicates a moderate danger to the patient.  
1.  (Low): Order check indicates a low danger to the patient.  
For a High value, the order check will be displayed when the provider goes to accept the order. If the provider accepts the order with High clinical danger, CPRS will require the provider to enter a justification for overriding when the provider attempts to sign the order. The order cannot be signed without a justification.

ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• CPRS exports the Duplicate Drug Order order check with a “High” clinical danger level. This indicates duplicate medication orders do display an order check message, then prompt users for an override reason. To prevent the override prompt, set the Clinical Danger Level for this order check to “Moderate.” Providers get the order check message, but will not be prompted for an override reason.  
**ORK CONTRAST MEDIA CREATININE [Option: ORK CONTRAST MEDIA CREATININE]**  
This option is used by the Biochem Abnormality for Contrast Media order check. This order check displays a message if the patient doesn’t have a serum creatinine result within the past X days, where the number of days is determined by the value of this parameter. The exported value is 30 [days].

ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: System

**ORK CT LIMIT HT [Option: ORK CT LIMIT HT]**  
This parameter is used by order checking to determine if a patient is too tall to be examined by the CT scanner. The value indicates the maximum height (in inches) allowed.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• For systems with CT scanners at more than one division, set the value of this parameter at the division level to correspond to that division’s scanner height limit.  
**ORK CT LIMIT WT [Option: ORK CT LIMIT WT]**  
This parameter is used by order checking to determine if a patient weighs too much to be safely examined by the CT scanner. The value indicates the maximum weight (in pounds) allowed.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• For systems with CT scanners at more than one division, set the value of this parameter at the division level to correspond to that division’s scanner weight limit.  
**ORK DEBUG ENABLE/DISABLE [Option: ORK DEBUG ENABLE/DISABLE]**  
This parameter determines if order checking logs debug messages into \^XTMP("ORKLOG".) The possible values are a set of codes:  
**E** (Enabled): Indicates the Order Checking debug log is activated.  
**D** (Disabled): Indicates the Order Checking debug log is inactivated and deleted.  
Information passed to order checking from OE/RR is stored in the zero node. The zero node is in the format:

\^XTMP("ORKLOG",\<order check date/time\>,\<pt id\>,\<orderable item\>,\<dlog mode\>, \<user id\>,0)= \<orderable item\>\|\<filler\>\|\<natl id\^natl text\^natl sys\^local id\^local text\^ local sys\>\|\<order effective date/time\>\|\<order number\>\|\<filler data\>\|.  
***

The data for non-zero node entries is the information passed from order checking back to OE/RR. It is the order check messages plus other info to enhance OE/RR processing. It is in the format:  
\^XTMP("ORKLOG",\<order check date/time\>,\<pt id\>,\<orderable item\>,\<dlog mode\>, \<user id\>,\<non-zero\>)= \<order number\>\^\<order check id - 864.5 ien\>\^\<clin danger level\>\^\<message\>  
This parameter is used primarily for troubleshooting. Under normal circumstances it should be “Disabled.” When this debug global exceeds 5,000 entries, it is killed and begins adding new entries.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
***

**Customization Suggestion:**  
• To determine if a particular type of order check is occurring, set this parameter to be “Enabled” and check the debug log global periodically.  
**ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB [Option: ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB]**  
This parameter indicates how many hours back in time to look for duplicate lab orders. If a similar lab order has been placed within the number of hours indicated in this parameter, an order check message is displayed. Lab orders with an OE/RR order status of “Canceled,” “Discontinued,” “Expired,” “Lapsed,” “Discontinued/Edit,” or “Delayed” are not evaluated when looking for duplicates.

**☞ NOTE: This parameter is superseded if the ordered lab procedure has a corresponding orderable item entered in the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI parameter.**  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Location  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Service  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 4 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• Use this parameter to set a duplicate order value for the majority of lab procedures, then use ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI to set duplicate order values for lab procedures with special duplicate order ranges. (Refer to ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI customization suggestions for an example.)  
**ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI [Option: ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI]**  
This parameter indicates how many hours back in time to look for duplicate orders with a matching orderable item. If an order with the same orderable item has been placed within the number of hours indicated in this parameter, an order check message is displayed. For the order check to occur, the orderable item selected via this parameter must match both the orderable item of the order being placed and the duplicate order’s orderable item. Orders are linked to orderable items through the order dialog setup. Use this parameter to set duplicate order search ranges for special orderable items. This parameter does not affect medication duplicate order ranges. Medication order duplicates are determined within the Pharmacy package. A value of “0” (zero) indicates duplicate order checking for this orderable item does not occur.

**☞ NOTE: If the orderable item of the order being placed has a value in this parameter, this parameter’s value supersedes values entered in the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB/RADIOLOGY parameters.]**  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Location  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Service  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 4 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestions:**  
• Use the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB parameter to set a duplicate order value for the majority of lab procedures, then use ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI to set duplicate order values for lab tests with special duplicate order ranges. For example, the exported default value for ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB is “48” hours. Use ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB to change that value to “24” hours for your System entity. Next, use ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI at your System entity level to set the duplicate order range for the CBC orderable item to “12” hours. The order check message indicating a duplicate CBC order will now occur if the patient has a previous CBC order within the past 12 hours.  
**☞ NOTE: The order being placed and the duplicate order must each have an orderable item that matches the CBC orderable item entered via this parameter.**  
The order check for CBC will not occur if the patient’s most recent CBC order occurred 13 hours previously. However, if the order is for a different lab test (and no parameter value for that test exists), the order check message will occur if the patient’s most recent lab test was within the past 24 hours.  
• In addition to the suggestion above, set the ICU (Location entity), value of ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI to “3” hours for orderable item CBC. Now, if the CBC order is for a patient in ICU, the order check occurs only if the most recent order is within the past three hours. CBC orders older than three hours do not trigger the order check for patients in ICU. For non-ICU patients the duplicate range value remains “12” hours.  
• To prevent duplicate order checks on generic nursing orders placed by General Medicine providers (Service entity), use this parameter to set General Medicine’s value of the generic nursing orderable item to “0” (zero.) Remember, the generic nursing orderable item identified in the parameter must match the orderable item of the order dialog used to place generic nursing orders.  
**ORK DUP ORDER RANGE RADIOLOGY [Option: ORK DUP ORDER RANGE RADIOLOGY]**  
This parameter indicates how many hours back in time to look for duplicate imaging orders. If a similar imaging procedure has been placed within the number of hours indicated in this parameter, an order check message is displayed. Imaging orders with an OE/RR order status of “Canceled,” “Discontinued,” “Expired,” “Lapsed,” “Discontinued/Edit,” or “Delayed” are not evaluated when looking for duplicates.  
**☞ NOTE: This parameter is superseded if the ordered imaging procedure has a corresponding orderable item entered in the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI parameter.**  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Location  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: Service  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 3 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 4 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• Use this parameter to set a duplicate order value for the majority of imaging procedures then use ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI to set duplicate order values for imaging procedures with special duplicate order ranges. (Refer to ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI customization suggestions for a similar example with lab procedures.)  
**ORK MRI LIMIT HT [Option: ORK MRI LIMIT HT]**  
This parameter is used by order checking to determine if a patient is too tall to be examined in the MRI scanner. The value indicates the maximum height (in inches) allowed.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• For systems with MRI scanners at more than one division, set the value of this parameter at the division level to correspond to that division’s scanner height limit.  
**ORK MRI LIMIT WT [Option: ORK MRI LIMIT WT]**  
This parameter is used by order checking to determine if a patient weighs too much to be safely examined by the MRI scanner. The value indicates the maximum weight (in pounds) allowed.  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 1 ENTITY TYPE: Division  
ENTITY PRECEDENCE: 2 ENTITY TYPE: System  
**Customization Suggestion:**  
• For systems with MRI scanners at more than one division, set the value of this parameter at the division level to correspond to that division’s scanner weight limit.  
**ORK PROCESSING FLAG [Option: ORK PROCESSING FLAG]**  
This parameter determines if an order check will be processed. Potential values are a set of codes:  
**E** (Enabled): Order check enabled for the entity unless an entity of higher precedence has the order check disabled (e.g. Enabled at System level and Disabled at User level—order check will not be processed for that user.)  
**D** (Disabled): Order check disabled for entity unless entity of higher precedence has order check Enabled (e.g. Disabled at System level and Enabled at User level—order check will be processed for that user.)

**ORK SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE [Option: ORK SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE]**  
This parameter determines if any CPRS Order Check processing will occur. In effect, it enables or disables all order check processing.  
**E** (Enabled): Order checking is enabled and running.  
**D** (Disabled): Order checking is disabled and not running.

### CPRS Order Checks: How They Work

#### Introduction

In CPRS, Order Checks occur by evaluating a requested order against existing patient data. Most order checks are processed via the CPRS Expert System. A few are processed within the Pharmacy, Allergy Tracking System, and Order Entry packages. See the table below to determine how an order check is generated:

Order Checks are a real-time process that occurs during the ordering session and is driven by responses entered by the ordering provider. Order Check messages are displayed interactively in the ordering session.

Order Checks review existing data and current events to produce a relevant message, which is presented to patient caregivers. Order Checks use the CPRS Expert System (OCX namespace), to define logical expressions for this evaluation and message creation. In addition to the expert system Order Checks have some hard-coded algorithms. For example, the drug-drug interaction order check is made via an entry point in the pharmacy package whereas Renal Functions for Patients Over 65 is defined as a rule in the CPRS Expert System.

Once some order checks have fired, they do not fire again for 5 minutes to save the system from making multiple calls. So, once these order checks have fired, they will not fire again for 5 minutes (300 seconds) for any reason. Logging off or refreshing the patient will have no impact. The following order checks follow this rule:

-   ALLERGY-CONTRAST MEDIA INTERACTION  
-   AMINOGLYCOSIDE ORDERED  
-   BIOCHEM ABNORMALITY FOR CONTRAST MEDIA  
-   CLOZAPINE APPROPRIATENESS  
-   CT & MRI PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS  
-   DANGEROUS MEDS FOR PT \> 64  
-   ESTIMATED CREATININE CLEARANCE  
-   GLUCOPHAGE-CONTRAST MEDIA  
-   GLUCOPHAGE-LAB RESULTS  
-   MISSING LAB TESTS FOR ANGIOGRAM PROCEDURE  
-   NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT  
-   POLYPHARMACY  
-   RECENT BARIUM STUDY  
-   RECENT ORAL CHOLECYSTOGRAM  
-   RENAL FUNCTIONS OVER AGE 65  
#### Order Check Data Caching

Data caching was recently added to improve the speed of order checks. Before data caching, order checks could be slow because each order check retrieved data from the other VISTA packages—even if the order checks used the same data. With data caching, the first order check in an ordering session retrieves data from other VISTA packages, uses the data to evaluate whether it should display a warning, and then stores the retrieved data in the \^XTMP(“OCXCACHE” global for five minutes. The order checks that occur in the next five minutes can use the cached data, if it is the appropriate data, instead of retrieving data from the other packages. After five minutes, the cached data expires, and order checks must retrieve new data from the VISTA packages.

For example, before data caching was implemented, if an order check took 3 seconds to retrieve data from other VISTA packages, and there were 12 order checks, clinicians might wait 36 seconds to sign orders. With data caching, the first order check might take 3 seconds to retrieve the data, but subsequent order checks could use the cache and might take only .03 seconds each. That would be 3.33 seconds compared to 36 seconds. The numbers in this example are for illustration only and do not reflect real system speed. However, data caching should speed up order checks.

To avoid using all available disk space for storing data from order checks, there are several ways to clear the \^XTMP(“OCXCACHE” global. ORMTIME removes data from the global when it runs. The suggested frequency for running ORMTIME is every 30 minutes, but not every site runs it that frequently. Kernel clean up utilities also remove data from the cache when they run, which is usually every 24 hours. If needed, users that have access to the programmer’s prompt can manually clear the cache from that prompt by using PURGE\^OCXCACHE.

Below is an example of what the \^XTMP(“OCXCACHE” global looks like:

\^XTMP("OCXCACHE",0) = 3020815.111506\^3020814.111506

#### Remote Order Checking

**Note:** Remote order checks will be available at sites when the RDI software, including patches OR\*3.0\*232, OR\*3.0\*238, OR\*3.0\*267, GMRA\*4.0\*26, and GMRA\*4.0\*37, is installed at each site. The RDI rollout is planned as a phased roll out that will last several months until all sites have the software installed. In addition, data from Department of Defense (DoD) facilities will not be available until the CHDR project is released.  
Remote Data Interoperability (RDI) enables CPRS to do drug-drug, drug-drug class, duplicate drug, drug-allergy, and contrast media allergy order checks against data from VA sites, and from participating DoD sites, that is stored in the Health Data Repository (HDR).

RDI uses the same order checks that currently exist in CPRS and adds the benefit of doing those checks against remote Outpatient Pharmacy and remote Allergy data stored in the HDR.

The order checks look very similar to the current order check display in CPRS. For remote medications, the display now includes the date of last refill, quantity dispensed, and the name of the remote location. The display for remote allergies has the words “remote site(s)”.

##### When Will RDI Be Enabled?

RDI features being enabled depends on two things:

The value of the parameter OR RDI HAVE HDR

The existence and configuration of the logical link ORHDR

The menu option to change the value of the OR RDI HAVE HDR parameter will be available in patch OR\*3.0\*238. Until then, the remote order checking features of RDI will be dormant.

**Note:** Sites should not enable the OR RDI HAVE HDR parameter until they receive official instructions.  
How Does RDI Work?

When an order check is needed either because a CPRS user is writing orders or because CPRS receives a request from Outpatient Pharmacy, CPRS sends a request to Clinical Data Service (CDS) for outpatient medication and allergy information.

The request includes the following data, not necessarily in this order:

-   patient internal control number (ICN)  
-   dates (t-30 for outpatient medications with an expired or discontinued status, plus all other statuses—all allergies are returned)  
-   domain (such as outpatient medications)  
Which Items Are NOT Used in Remote Order Checks?

Some items are not used in remote order checking because they are not stored in the HDR. Others have a high annoyance factor and therefore were not included at the request of field sites. The following items are not included in remote order checks:

-   Inpatient Medications  
-   Non-VA Meds  
-   Supply items  
-   Local drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File  
**Note:** The HDR II contains prescriptions with drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File (NDF). This prescription data should be used in remote order checking for duplicate drug classes. Because the National Drug File is updated regularly, these missing order checks could be resolved whenever the NDF is updated. Some drugs may never be matched, especially drugs used in research.  
***

What Happens when CPRS Receives Data from the HDR?

If CPRS receives data from CDS, CPRS stores the data in the global \^XTMP("ORRDI") for the amount of time specified in the OR RDI CACHE TIME parameter; the default is 120 minutes, but sites can change this value. CPRS does not request data from CDS again during the order session unless more than the specified time has elapsed.

Order checks from CPRS can happen several times during a CPRS session:

-   Beginning to write/copy/change orders – When a user selects an order menu to begin writing orders, CPRS requests some order checks, such as polypharmacy, renal function, or creatinine clearance, for example.  
-   On order acceptance – When the user selects Accept, CPRS requests the order checks.  
-   Signature of orders – When a user signs the order, CPRS requests order checks.  
Outpatient Pharmacy and Adverse Reaction Tracking process the information CPRS provides and sends all drug-drug, drug-drug class, contrast media allergy, and drug-allergy order checks back to CPRS for display to the user. For drug-drug and drug-drug class interactions, the message CPRS displays also shows the last refill date, quantity dispensed, and the facility name where the medication was prescribed; allergy information and information about local order checks do not include the facility name. The facility information is provided as a convenience to the user.

With RDI, when a user writes an inpatient or outpatient medication order, an order check against remote outpatient medications is done. The order check is done against all active outpatient medications and all outpatient medications that expired or were discontinued less than 30 days in the past. If the user records that the patient is taking a Non-VA medication, the order check will happen against remote outpatient medication data. However, neither Non-VA medications nor inpatient medications on other systems (remote Non-VA medications nor remote inpatient medications) can be used for order checking because they are not in the HDR.

What If CPRS Receives No Data from the HDR?

If CPRS does not receive a response from CDS within the amount of time specified in the logical link ORHDR, the order checks will be done against local data only. In this case, CPRS displays a “Remote Order Checking not available – checks done on local data only” message at the bottom of the order check screen once during the ordering session (so it will appear once for each patient if there is a problem receiving HDR data) to inform the user that order checks are using only local data. However, in the background, CPRS continues to attempt to communicate with the HDR (by pinging). When communication with the HDR is reestablished, users will begin to see remote order checks again.

**Note:** A national announcement (“Automated Notification Report” or ANR) is sent out when problems with the HDR might be occurring or when scheduled maintenance will occur that would create situations when the HDR will not be available. Someone at your site should monitor ANR messages so that your site will be aware of these outages and can prepare for them or alert staff as needed.  
There are several reasons why CPRS might not receive data from the HDR:  
**The HDR could be down** – The HDR is a database that stores a great deal of data about VHA patients. Because it is new, the HDR may experience some problems. There are many pieces to the communication that takes place between the HDR and a local site, both software and hardware, including Clinical Data Service (CDS) and the database itself, just to name a few; failure of any piece may disrupt communication with the HDR. This might also cause a site to see the “Remote Order Checking not available – checks done on local data only” message.  
**The site may experience local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) problems** – In addition to the HDR software and hardware, each site has a LAN and connections to the WAN that could be having problems. This might also cause a site to see the “Remote Order Checking not available – checks done on local data only” message.  
**The patient may not have a national identifier** – Each patient should have a unique number (called an Integration Control Number (ICN)) that identifies the patient nationally. This number is used by the Master Patient Index (MPI), Remote Data View (RDV), Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV), and other applications. If a patient does not have an ICN, CPRS displays the “Remote Order Checking not available – checks done on local data only” message. In addition, none of the applications mentioned can get data for the patient from other sites, including from the HDR.  
Setting RDI Parameters

Patch OR\*3.0\*238 activates the menu OR RDI PARAMS. This menu sets two parameters:

**OR RDI HAVE HDR** – This parameter defines whether CPRS should query the HDR for remote allergy and Outpatient Pharmacy data. If set to NO, CPRS will not request any remote data for order checking from the HDR. The default is NO, but this parameter is set to YES when patch OR\*3.0\*238 is installed.  
**OR RDI CACHE TIME** – This parameter defines how long (the number of minutes) CPRS should cache the remote allergy and outpatient pharmacy data after it is retrieved so it can used for order checks. The default is 120 minutes, but can be from 0 to 9999 minutes. A setting of 0 (zero) means that data will be requested every time an order check is needed, which would increase WAN traffic significantly. If the data is older than the time set in this parameter, CPRS will request the data from the HDR again when one of the triggers described above occurs, such as an order being accepted.  
**Note:** To edit the values of these parameters, users must use the OR RDI PARAMS menu. Users will not be able to use the general parameter editing menu options, such as XPAR EDIT.

#### Trigger Methods

Order checks are triggered via four main ordering events:

1.  Ordering dialog/display  
1.  Orderable item selection  
1.  Order acceptance  
1.  Ordering session completion  
In addition, order checking is triggered by three special events:

1.  Delayed/time-release orders initiated  
1.  Orders Renewed or Edited  
1.  Orders signed in a later session (delayed signature)  
##### Order Checks Categorized by Event

#### Non-VA Medications Order Check Exceptions

Ordering non-VA meds triggers the following order checks:

Duplicate Drug (seen as Duplicate Order check)  
Duplicate Drug Class  
Critical Drug Interaction  
Significant Drug Interaction  
Allergy  
These order checks can appear at the end of the session or on selection based on the trigger. Two differences exist for non-VA medications:

1.  **Duplicate Drug Class**—CPRS does not perform a Duplicate Drug Class order check for interactions between inpatient medications and non-VA medications.  
1.  **Allergies**—Allergies checks for non-VA medications are slightly different. The following three rules apply:  
-   **Allergy to Medications Designated as Herbals**—If a clinician enters an allergy to an herbal (e.g., Gingko) that is in the drug class HA000 in a patient’s record, users should get an allergy-drug interaction order check when they enter that same herbal as a non-VA medication for that patient.  
-   **Allergy for Herbal Drug Class**—If a clinician enters an allergy to an herbal (e.g., Gingko - class HA000) in a patient’s record, users should NOT get an allergy-drug interaction order check when they enter another item (e.g., Ginger) with that same **drug** **class**. All herbal medications have the same drug class HA000, which makes that order check ineffective.  
-   **Allergy for Non-VA Meds from Other Drug Classes**—However, if a clinician enters an allergy to a drug (e.g., famotidine - class GA301) into a patient’s record and then enters another drug from that same class as a non-VA med (e.g., Ranitidine), users should get the allergy-drug interaction order check.  
#### Recipient Determination

In general, order check processing is determined via the ORK SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE and ORK PROCESSING FLAG parameters. Specific order checks can also be affected by other parameters in the ORK namespace. These are discussed with the individual order checks later in this document. Order check determination occurs in the following order:

1.  Check the value of the parameter ORK SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE. If it is ‘D’isabled, do not process or send any order checks (other than indicating the order checking system is disabled.) If it is ‘E’nabled, process order checks as outlined below.  
1.  Processing is evaluated according to values set for entities identified in the parameter ORK PROCESSING FLAG. These entity values are accessed via the Option ORK PROCESSING FLAG also called Enable/Disable an Order Check. These entity values are processed in the following order to determine if that order check should be processed or not.  
**highest entity        lowest entity**  
user -\> inpatient location -\> user service/specialty -\> division -\> system -\> OERR  
#### Dialog with User

The order check user dialog occurs in the following steps:  
1) List of order check messages are presented to user sorted by clinical danger level.  
2) Based on the order check’s clinical danger level and user’s OE/RR 2.5 elec signature key:  
-   User holds OREMAS key:  
Process without prompting for justification but allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’ the order  
-   User does not hold OREMAS key and clinical danger level is ‘2’ (Moderate) or ‘3’ (Low):  
Process without prompting for justification but allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’ the order  
-   User does not hold OREMAS key and clinical danger level is ‘1’ (High):  
Prompt for justification by prompting to ‘Cancel’ or ‘Override’. If the user selects ‘Override’, prompt for justification (enter free text). If a justification is entered, allow them to ‘Cancel’ or ‘OK’  
3) Order check messages and any accompanying over-ride justifications are sent with the order to the filling package and are displayed in the order’s detailed display. If the clinical danger level for an order check message is “High” (value of ‘1’), the order check message and justification are stored in the Order file [\#100] under the ‘9’ node.  
####

#### Order Check Specifics

Each order check and how it works is described below.

**Allergy-Contrast Media Interactions**  
Trigger: Selection of a Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item against the orderable item file to determine if it uses a contrast media. If it does, the Allergy Tracking System (ATS) is requested to determine if the patient has a known allergy to contrast media. If both of these conditions are true, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Patient allergic to contrast medias: \<list of contrast media allergens (barium or unspecified)\>.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Allergy-Drug Interactions**  
Trigger: Acceptance of a pharmacy order and signature of pharmacy order.  
Mechanism: The Allergy Tracking System (ATS) is requested to determine if the patient has a known allergy to an ingredient in the medication ordered and/or a VA Drug Class to which the medication ordered belongs. If ATS finds an allergy/adverse reaction, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
In addition, the VA Drug Class of the medication ordered is compared against the VA Drug Class of existing drug allergens. The comparison is made of the first four characters of the drug classes. The exception is the Analgesics class where the first five characters are compared. For example, CN101 will NOT match CN103 and the order check will NOT occur.  
Message: Previous adverse reaction to: \<list of med allergens\>.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Aminoglycoside Ordered**  
Trigger: Ordering session completion.  
Mechanism: For each medication order placed during this ordering session, the CPRS Expert System requests the pharmacy package to determine if the medication belongs to the VA Drug Class ‘Aminoglycosides.’ If so, the patient’s most recent BUN results are used to calculate the creatinine clearance then OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
[**Note:** The creatinine clearance value displayed in some order check messages is an estimate based on adjusted body weight if patient height is \> 60 inches. Approved by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup 8/11/04, it is based on a modified Cockcroft-Gault formula and was installed with patch OR\*3\*221.  
CrCl (male) = (140 - age) x (adj body weight\* in kg)

\--------------------------------------

(serum creatinine) x 72

\* If patient height is not greater than 60 inches, actual body weight is used.  
-   CrCl (female) = 0.85 x CrCl (male)  
-   To calculate adjusted body weight, the following equations are used:  
-   Ideal body weight (IBW) = 50 kg x (for men) or 45 kg x (for women) + 2.3 x (height in inches - 60)  
-   Adjusted body weight (Adj. BW) if the ratio of actual BW/IBW \> 1.3 = (0.3 x (Actual BW - IBW)) + IBW  
-   Adjusted body weight if the ratio of actual BW/IBW is not \> 1.3 = IBW or Actual BW (whichever is less)]  
Message: Aminoglycoside - est. CrCl: \<value calculated from most recent serum creatinine\>. (CREAT: \<result\> BUN: \<result\>).  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Biochem (BUN, creatinine) Abnormality For Contrast Media**  
Trigger: Selection of Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item against the orderable item file to determine if it uses a contrast media. If so:  
a) the patient’s BUN and creatinine results are checked for abnormal or critical values. If abnormal or critical values exist, OERR is notified and warning message “a)” is displayed.  
b) the patient’s creatinine results are checked to determine if they occurred within x days. (“X” is obtained from the ORK CONTRAST MEDIA CREATININE parameter.) If no results within x days exist, OERR is notified and warning message “b)” is displayed.  
Message: a) Procedure uses contrast media - abnormal biochem result: \<BUN and/or creatinine results with D/T\>.  
b) Procedure uses non-barium contrast media - no creatinine results within X days  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Clozapine appropriateness**  
Trigger: Selection of Clozapine orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System asks Pharmacy api (EN\^PSODRG) if the medication is clozapine. If so, it checks for WBC and/or ANC results within past x days then notifies OERR and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Clozapine – Most recent WBC result: \<WBC result & collection d/t\> else:  
No WBC past fourteen days - pharmacy cannot fill clozapine order. Most recent WBC result: \<WBC result & collection d/t\>  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Critical Drug interaction**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item for existing medications and at the conclusion of an ordering session against meds placed in that session.  
Mechanism: The Pharmacy package is requested to determine if the patient is currently receiving a medication which will interact in a critical manner with the drug selected for ordering. If Pharmacy finds a drug-drug interaction, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Critical drug-drug interaction: \<drug1\> & \<drug2\> (text and status of offending medication order)  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**CT and MRI physical limitations**  
Trigger: Selection of Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item’s imaging type. If it is “CT” or “MRI,” patient height and weight are retrieved from the Vitals package and compared against parameter values related to the maximum height and weight tolerances of CT and/or MRI devices at the site or division. If the patient height is greater than the value for parameter ORK CT LIMIT HT the message “Patient may be too tall for the CT scanner”, is sent to OERR and displayed. If the patient height is greater than the value for parameter ORK MRI LIMIT HT the message “Patient may be too tall for the MRI scanner”, is sent to OERR and displayed. If the patient weight is greater than the value for parameter ORK CT LIMIT WT the message “Patient may be too heavy for the CT scanner”, is sent to OERR and displayed. If the patient weight is greater than the value for parameter ORK MRI LIMIT WT the message “Patient may be too heavy for the MRI scanner”, is sent to OERR and displayed. These parameter values are not exported with CPRS so they must be set at the site for this order check to function. Values are set via options under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU. They should be set at the System level for single division sites and multi-division sites with one device (CT and/or MRI). Values should be set at the Division level for multi-division sites with more than one CT and/or MRI device. For example, a three division site with three CT devices and one MRI device would set the values for the CT-related parameters at the Division level and the values for the MRI-related parameters at the System level.  
Message: Patient may be too \<tall/heavy\> for the \<CT/MRI\>.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Dangerous Meds for Pt \> 64**  
Trigger: Acceptance of pharmacy orderable items amitriptyline, chlorpropamide or dipyridamole.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System determines if the patient is greater than 64 years old. It then checks the orderable item of the medication ordered to determine if it is mapped as a local term to the national term DANGEROUS MEDS FOR PTS \> 64.  
Message: If the orderable item text contains AMITRIPTYLINE this message is displayed:  
Patient is \<age\>. Amitriptyline can cause cognitive impairment and loss of balance in older patients. Consider other antidepressant medications on formulary.  
If the orderable item text contains CHLORPROPAMIDE this message is displayed:  
Patient is \<age\>. Older patients may experience hypoglycemia with Chlorpropamide due do its long duration and variable renal secretion. They may also be at increased risk for Chlorpropamide-induced SIADH.  
If the orderable item text contains DIPYRIDAMOLE this message is displayed:  
Patient is \<age\>. Older patients can experience adverse reactions at high doses of Dipyridamole (e.g., headache, dizziness, syncope, GI intolerance.) There is also questionable efficacy at lower doses.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Dispense Drug Not Selected**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item.  
Mechanism: The person entering the order does not select an entry from the Dispense Drug file [\#50], OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: The order checks: drug interaction, duplicate drug, duplicate drug class and drug allergy were not processed because the medication order was not based on dispense drug.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Duplicate Drug Class Order**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item for existing medications and at the conclusion of an ordering session against meds placed in that session.  
Mechanism: The Pharmacy package is requested to determine if the patient is currently receiving a medication which will belongs to a VA Drug Class to which the drug selected for ordering belongs. If so, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Duplicate drug class order: \<class\> (text and status of offending medication order)  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Duplicate drug order**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item for existing medications and at the conclusion of an ordering session against meds placed in that session.  
Mechanism: The Pharmacy package is requested to determine if the patient is currently receiving a medication which matches the drug selected for ordering. Inpatient med orders only check against the patient’s inpatient meds. Outpatient med orders only consider outpatient orders. The comparison is done at the local, dispense drug level so an order for Aminophylline 100mg will trigger this order check if the patient is already receiving Aminophylline 100mg but not if the patient is already receiving Aminophylline 200mg. (However, a duplicate drug class order message will be displayed because Aminophylline 100mg and Aminophylline 200mg are in the same VA Drug Class.) If a duplicate is returned by Pharmacy, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Duplicate order: \<text and status of offending medication order\>  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Duplicate Opioid Medications**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item.  
Mechanism: The medication ordered is evaluated to determine if it is an opioid medication based upon VA Drug Classes “Opioid Analgesics” and “Opioid Antagonist Analgesics”. If the medication belongs in either drug class (is an opioid), the patient’s active pharmacy orders are evaluated for other orders belonging to an opioid drug class. If the patient already has an existing opioid order, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Duplicate opioid medications: \<text and status of duplicate opioid orders\>  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Duplicate Order (Non-Medication)**  
Trigger: Acceptance of non-pharmacy orderable item.  
Mechanism: If it’s a Lab order, the parameter ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI is checked for a value for this orderable item. If so this value is used to determine how many hours back in time to search for duplicate orders. Values for this parameter are not exported with CPRS. They can be set at the site at the Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU. If a value for the orderable item cannot be found in the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI parameter, the value for parameter ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB is used. The exported value for this parameter is 48 [hours]. ORK DUP ORDER RANGE LAB can be set at the Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU. After the search range hours are determined, the lab orderable item is equated with the equivalent local lab procedures, split into atomic lab procedures (if appropriate) then appended to the order’s specimen. Order Entry is then requested to provide a list of all lab orders placed for the patient from the current order’s date/time to the current order’s date/time minus the number of hours provided by the duplicate order range parameters. Orders with a status of Canceled, Discontinued, Expired, Lapsed, Replaced, or Delayed are ignored. The lab orders returned from Order Entry are equated with equivalent local lab procedures and if necessary, split into atomic lab procedures. The lab order being placed (and atomic procedures) are compared with previous orders (and atomic procedures) for duplicates. If found, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
If it’s a Radiology order, the parameter ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI is checked for a value for this orderable item. If so this value is used to determine how many hours back in time to search for duplicate orders. Values for this parameter are not exported with CPRS. They can be set at the site at the Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU. If a value for the orderable item cannot be found in the ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI parameter, the value for parameter ORK DUP ORDER RANGE RADIOLOGY is used. The exported value for this parameter is 48 [hours]. ORK DUP ORDER RANGE RADIOLOGY can be set at the Service, Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU. After the search range hours are determined, the Order file is searched for the same orderable item ordered for the patient from the current order’s date/time to the current order’s date/time minus the number of hours provided by the duplicate order range parameters. Orders with a status of Canceled, Discontinued, Expired, Lapsed, Replaced, or Delayed are ignored. If a duplicate is found, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
If it’s not a Pharmacy, Lab or Radiology order, the parameter ORK DUP ORDER RANGE OI is checked for a value for this orderable item. If none exists, 48 [hours] is the value used to determine the duplicate search range. The Order file is searched for the same orderable item ordered for the patient from the current order’s date/time to the current order’s date/time minus 48 hours. Orders with a status of Canceled, Discontinued, Expired, Lapsed, Replaced, or Delayed are ignored. If a duplicate is found, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
Message: Duplicate order: \<order text truncated to 60 characters\> \<last ordered date/time\> [\<order status\>] (if lab order: \*Most recent result: \<most recent result\>\*)  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Error Message**  
Trigger: Entry of ordering dialog, selection of orderable item, acceptance or order, completion of ordering session.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System is recompiling rules and is momentarily disabled, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
Message: Order checking is recompiling and momentarily disabled.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Low clinical danger level.  
**Estimated Creatinine Clearance If \< 50**  
Trigger: Entry of pharmacy ordering dialog  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System calculates the creatinine clearance based on the most recent serum creatinine results. If the value is less than 50 or it cannot be calculated, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
[**Note:** The creatinine clearance value displayed in some order check messages is an estimate based on adjusted body weight if patient height is \> 60 inches. Approved by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup 8/11/04, it is based on a modified Cockcroft-Gault formula and was installed with patch OR\*3\*221.  
CrCl (male) = (140 - age) x (adj body weight\* in kg)

\--------------------------------------

(serum creatinine) x 72

\* If patient height is not greater than 60 inches, actual body weight is used.  
-   CrCl (female) = 0.85 x CrCl (male)  
-   To calculate adjusted body weight, the following equations are used:  
-   Ideal body weight (IBW) = 50 kg x (for men) or 45 kg x (for women) + 2.3 x (height in inches - 60)  
-   Adjusted body weight (Adj. BW) if the ratio of actual BW/IBW \> 1.3 = (0.3 x (Actual BW - IBW)) + IBW  
-   Adjusted body weight if the ratio of actual BW/IBW is not \> 1.3 = IBW or Actual BW (whichever is less)]  
Message: Est. CrCl: \<value calculated from most recent serum creatinine\>. (CREAT: \<result\> BUN: \<result\>)  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Glucophage-Contrast Media Interactions**  
Trigger: Selection of a Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item against the orderable item file to determine if it uses a non-barium contrast media. If it does, the Pharmacy package is requested to return a list of all medications the patient is currently receiving. If one of these is glucophage/metformin OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Procedure uses non-barium contrast media and patient is taking glucophage.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Glucophage-Lab Results Interactions**  
Trigger: Selection of a Pharmacy orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the pharmacy orderable item’s local text (from the Dispense Drug file [\#50]) to determine if it contains “glucophage” or “metformin”. The expert system next searches for a serum creatinine result within the past x number of days as determined by parameter ORK GLUCOPHAGE CREATININE. It the patient’s creatinine result was greater than 1.5 or does not exist, OE/RR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Glucophage – no serum creatinine within past \<x\> days. else:  
Glucophage – Creatinine results: \<creatinine greater than 1.5 w/in past \<x\> days\>  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Lab Order Frequency Restrictions**  
Trigger: Acceptance of a Lab orderable item.  
Mechanism: The lab order is equated with equivalent local lab procedures and split into atomic lab procedures (if appropriate). Lab file fields Max Order Freq and Single Day Max Order Freq are checked for values and equated with the lab procedure/specimen.  
If a procedure/specimen contains a value for Max Order Freq, Order Entry is requested to provide a list of all lab orders placed for the patient from the current order’s date/time to the current order’s date/time minus the number of days indicated in field Max Order Freq. Orders with a status of Canceled, Discontinued, Expired, Lapsed, Replaced, Changed, or Delayed are ignored. The lab orders returned by Order Entry are equated with equivalent local lab procedures and split into atomic lab procedures (if appropriate). If the equivalent local lab procedure of a lab order returned by Order Entry equals an equivalent local lab procedure of the current order and the lab order returned by Order Entry was placed within the past *X* number of days (where *X* is the value of Max Order Freq), OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed. If Max Order Freq exists for a lab procedure/specimen, Single Day Max Order Freq is not processed. If a procedure/specimen does not contain a value for Max Order Freq but does have a Single Day Max Order Freq value, Order Entry is requested to provide a list of all lab orders placed on the same date as the current order’s date/time. Orders with a status of Canceled, Discontinued, Expired, Lapsed, Replaced, Changed, or Delayed are ignored. The lab orders are equated with equivalent local lab procedures and split into atomic lab procedures (if appropriate). If more duplicates than the value of Single Day Max Order Freq are found, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
Message: Max lab test order freq exceeded for: \<lab test\> or:  
Lab test daily order max exceeded for: \<lab test\>.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Missing Lab Tests For Angiogram Procedure**  
Trigger: At the conclusion of an ordering session.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item to determine if it is linked to OCX nat’l term ANGIOGRAM (PERIPHERAL) then determines if the required concurrent lab tests PROTHROMBIN TIME and THROMBOPLASTIN have been ordered in the same ordering session.  
Message: Missing labs for angiogram \<missing lab tests\>.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**No Allergy Assessment**  
Trigger: Acceptance of a Radiology, Pharmacy or Dietetics orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System calls into the Allergy Tracking System (ATS). If the patient has no allergy data on file, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Patient has no allergy assessment.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Order Checking Not Available/Supported**  
Trigger: Entry of any ordering dialog [Note: this order check is currently not triggered.]  
Mechanism: OERR checks the value of parameter ORK SYSTEM ENABLE/DISABLE. If it is ‘Disabled’, the message is displayed and no further order check processing occurs. The exported value for this parameter is ‘Disabled’. This prevents order checking from processing HL7 messages exchanged during conversions. It can be set at the Division and System levels. Values are set via an option under the menu option ORK ORDER CHK MGMT MENU.  
Message: Order checking currently not available/supported.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Low clinical danger level.  
**Polypharmacy**  
Trigger: Entry of pharmacy ordering dialog  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System calculates the number of active medications the patient is receiving. For inpatients, only inpatient meds are counted. If the patient is an outpatient, only outpatient meds are counted. Medications with a status of Expired, Discontinue, Deleted, or Renewed are not counted. Supplies are not counted. If the number is greater than number x, as determined by parameter ORK POLYPHARMACY, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
Message: Potential polypharmacy – patient is currently receiving \<number of meds\> medications.  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Recent Barium Study (w/in 2 Days)**  
Trigger: Selection of Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item against the orderable item file to determine if it uses a barium contrast media. If so, Order Entry is requested to provide a list of all radiology orders placed for the patient within the past 48 hours. Each radiology order is checked to determine if its related orderable item uses barium contrast media. If it does, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Recent barium study: \<order text truncated to 60 characters\> \<last ordered date/time\> [\<order status\>].  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Recent Cholecystogram (w/in 7 days)**  
Trigger: Acceptance of Radiology orderable item.  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the radiology orderable item against the orderable item file to determine if it is a cholecystogram. If so, Order Entry is requested to provide a list of all radiology orders placed for the patient within the past 7 days. Each radiology order is checked to determine if its related orderable item is a cholecystogram. If it does, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Recent cholecystogram: \<order text truncated to 60 characters\> \<last ordered date/time\> [\<order status\>].  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a High clinical danger level.  
**Renal Function (BUN, Creatinine) For Patients Over 65**  
Trigger: Entry of pharmacy ordering dialog  
Mechanism: The CPRS Expert System checks the patient age. If it is greater than 65, OERR is notified and a warning message is displayed.  
Message: Patient \> 65. Renal results: \<BUN and/or creatinine results with D/T\>  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
**Significant Drug Interaction**  
Trigger: Selection of Pharmacy orderable item for existing medications and at the conclusion of an ordering session against meds placed in that session.  
Mechanism: The Pharmacy package is requested to determine if the patient is currently receiving a medication which will interact in a significant manner with the drug selected for ordering. If Pharmacy finds a drug-drug interaction, OERR is notified and the warning message is displayed.  
Message: Significant drug-drug interaction: \<drug1\> & \<drug2\> (text and status of offending medication order)  
Danger Lvl: This order check is exported with a Moderate clinical danger level.  
## Appendix G: Creating, Editing, and Viewing Release Events

This appendix describes how to create, edit, and view a release event. Creating a release event allows CPRS users to write event-delayed orders that are not executed until the release event occurs. For example, you could create a release event called “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” that includes three different, but related treating specialties. A clinician could then write an order that would be delayed until the “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” release event occurred (i.e., the patient is transferred to one of the treating specialties). After the “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” event occurred, the order would be released.

### Creating a Release Event

### Creating a Child Release Event

A child release event is a variation of a main or parent release event. A child release event shares the same trigger event as its parent; however, a child release event can be assigned to a different order menu than its parent release event.

For example, suppose your facility has a release event named “transfer to surgery ICU” that releases orders when a patient is transferred to the surgery ICU. This release event is appropriate for most of your needs; however, when a clinician writes delayed orders for a transfer to the orthopedic surgery ICU, you would like the clinician to be presented with a slightly different order menu. In this example, you could create a child release event called “transfer to orthopedic surgery ICU”. This child event would share the same trigger event as its parent; however, clinicians who selected the “transfer to orthopedic surgery ICU” child release event would be presented with a different order menu.

**To create a child release event, follow these steps:**

1.  Open the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu [OR PARAM COORDINATOR MENU].

### Explanation of Release Event Prompts (Fields in the OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS file \#100.5)

The list below explains the additional prompts (fields) that you may encounter when entering a new release event:

*Display Text* – the name of the release event as it appears to CPRS users.  
*Type of Event* – the type of release event. The value of this field can be A (admission event), T (transfer event), D (discharge event), O (O.R. event), or M (manual release event).  
*Division* – the division to which the release event will apply.  
-   For admission events the division is the admitting location.  
-   For discharge events the division is the location the patient is leaving.  
-   For transfer events the division is the receiving location where the patient will be transferred.  
-   For O.R. events the division is the location where the patient will have the procedure.  
-   For manual release events the division is where the patient will be located.  
*MAS Movement Type* – the MAS movement type that will trigger this release event.  
-   For admission and discharge events it is recommended that this field be left blank unless you have a need for a very specific admission/discharge event. This way, any admission/discharge type will release delayed orders.  
-   For O.R. events a MAS Movement type is not required.  
*Select Included Locations* – the locations included in the release event.  
*Select Included Treating Specialties* – the treating specialties included in the release event.  
-   For OR events a treating specialty is not required.  
*Short Name* – a short name for the release event (used when space is limited on the Orders tab).  
*Event Order Dialog* – the name of the dialog that appears when a user writes an event-delayed order assigned to the release event.  
-   For admission events use OR(Z) MOVE EVENT or ADMIT PATIENT.  
-   For discharge events use OR(Z) GXMOVE EVENT or DISCHARGE.  
-   For transfer events use OR(Z) GXMOVE EVENT or TRANSFER.  
***

![OR GXMOVE EVENT](media/e04ecec34bfb6c5332b0caa8aedac3c1.png)  
**The OR GXMOVE EVENT dialog**  
*Order Set Menu* – the order set/menu that will appear when a user writes an event-delayed order assigned to the release event.  
**NOTE:** Order sets listed in this field should be part of an order menu.  
*Lapse in \# Days* – the number of days that an event-delayed order assigned to the release event will remain active. Once the number of days specified is exceeded, you can no longer release orders assigned to this release event.  
*Ordering Parameters Location* – the location that the release event will use to retrieve its ordering parameters.  
-   For admission, transfer, O.R., and manual release events, be sure to specify a representative location so that the appropriate parameter values for dialogs (such as dietetics and lab) are used.  
-   For discharge events it is recommended that you specify a representative location so that the appropriate parameter values for dialogs are used. However, this is not required because the patient will be leaving the facility.  
*Copy Active Orders* – indicates whether a user should be permitted to copy existing active orders to new event-delayed orders.  
-   For admission and discharge events this field is usually set to no.  
-   For transfer events this field is usually set to yes.  
**NOTE: You can configure the OREVNT EXCLUDE DGRP parameter to prevent orders belonging to specific display groups from being copied. For more information, refer to** [**Excluding Display Groups from the Copy Active Orders Dialog Box**](#-15)

### Controlling who can Manually Release Orders

The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL and OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameters determine who can manually release an event-delayed order.  
The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameter determines if the permission to manually release an event-delayed order is granted by:  
-   the ORES and ORELSE keys (keys only).  
-   the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (manual release parameter only).-or-  
-   the ORES and ORELSE keys and the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (both keys and parameter).  
The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter must also be set if the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameter is set to “manual release parameter only” or to “both keys and parameter.”

-   **P (Manual Release Parameter Only)** Use this setting if you want the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter (discussed below) to control who can manually release an event-delayed order.  
-   **B (Both Keys and Parameter)** If you choose this option, CPRS will first check to see if the user has the ORES or ORELSE key. If they do, they will be allowed to manually release an event-delayed order. If the user does not have the ORES or ORELSE key, CPRS will then check the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter to see if they should be allowed to manually release the order.  
**NOTE**: **If you select P or B, you will also need to set the OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE parameter by following the instructions below in the** [**Setting the Manual Release Parameter (OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE)**](#-14) **section.**

### Files Associated with Release Events

#### OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS (\#100.5)

This file contains the locally-defined events that can release delayed orders within each division. It is strongly recommended that this file not be edited with File Manager. Instead, CACs should use the event-delayed orders menu [OR DELAYED ORDERS]

**Fields in OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS (\#100.5)**

| .1           | SHORT NAME                    | This field contains a shorter version of the Display Text field. The Short Name is used to display and group delayed orders on the Orders tab when space is limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1            | INACTIVATED                   | This field contains the date and time that this release event will become inactive. Once this date/time has passed, you will no longer be able to delay new orders to this release event. However, any event-delayed orders that are already associated with this release event will still be released when the event occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 2            | TYPE OF EVENT                 | This is the event that should cause delayed orders to be released to the service(s) for action. For OR events, the orders will be released when the TIME PAT IN OR field is entered in the Surgery package.  Orders delayed for Manual Release will not be automatically released by CPRS at all and can only be released via the "Release to Service" action by a user who is authorized to do so.  Authorization is controlled by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL, which Let sites choose whether release is controlled by keys or by the parameter OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE or both.                                                       |
| 3            | DIVISION                      | This is the division that this event will apply to. For transfers across divisions, this field should be the new division that the patient is going to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 4            | EVENT ORDER DIALOG            | This field contains the name of the dialog that will appear when you are writing a generic event-delayed order that requests this release event. If such an order is not necessary for this event, leave this field empty.  Unlike other delayed orders, the order created by this dialog will become active right away when signed and be visible on the Active Orders view as well as with the delayed orders on the Orders tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5            | ORDER SET/MENU                | This is a menu or order set containing items that are either necessary or commonly ordered when this event occurs.  The menu or order specified in this field will be invoked when first placing delayed orders for this event. If an EVENT ORDER DIALOG was defined for this event, this order set/menu will be presented to the user immediately following that dialog. This field may be any type of order dialog except prompt types.  Note: Order sets listed in this field should be part of an order menu.                                                                                                                                      |
| 6            | LAPSE IN \#DAYS               | Patient events are evaluated whenever delayed orders are acted upon or viewed. If the number of days specified in this field have passed since delayed orders were entered for this event and for this patient, then the status of all orders delayed for this event will be changed to "lapsed" and the patient event itself will be terminated. The orders can no longer be released to the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 7            | MAS MOVEMENT TYPE             | This is an MAS Movement Type that can further define this event. This field is optional, but if it is defined then it must match the patient's movement data to satisfy the event and cause any delayed orders to be released.  For example, to have delayed orders released when a patient returns from pass, enter the movement type of AUTH ABSENCE 96 HOURS OR LESS, or leave this field empty to have the transfer event defined by other criteria such as treating specialty or ward location.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8            | DISPLAY TEXT                  | This field is the name of the event as it will appear to the user in CPRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 9            | ORDERING PARAMETERS LOCATION  | Many order dialogs use parameters that depend on location. The location specified in the Ordering Parameters Location field is used as the default location for retrieving those parameter values when delaying orders to this event.

## Appendix H: Automatically Discontinuing Orders (Auto-DC Rules)

A CAC can set up rules that will automatically discontinue an order when a specific event occurs. These rules are known as auto-DC rules. For example, a CAC can set up an auto-DC rule named “Transfer to Medicine Treating Specialty” that automatically discontinues all lab, pharmacy, and diet orders when a patient is transferred to a medicine treating specialty. Although the auto-DC rule will discontinue lab, pharmacy, and diet orders, all other orders will remain active. A number of variables can be used in auto-DC rules, including specific divisions, orderable items, locations, and MAS movement types.

Prior to the release of OR\*3\*142 and OR\*3\*141, you could not specify which orders would be automatically discontinued when the specified event occurred. Instead, all of the orders would be discontinued.

**☞** **NOTE: OR\*3.0\*142 changes the way auto-DC rules are created and processed. After OR\*3.0\*142 is installed, existing auto-DC parameters will be converted into entries in the OE/RR Auto-DC Rules file (\#100.6). The entries in the OE/RR Auto-DC Rules are for your division. Multidivisional sites will need to make copies of these rules for the other divisions in the system.**

### Explanation of Auto-DC Rules Prompts (fields in the OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES FILE \#100.6)

The list below explains the additional prompts (fields) that you may encounter when entering a new auto-DC rule:

*Display Text* – The name of the auto-DC rule as it will appear to CPRS users.  
*Division* – The division that the auto-DC rule will apply to.  
-   For admission rules, the division reflects the admitting location*.*  
-   For discharge rules, the division reflects the location the patient is discharged from.  
-   For O.R. rules, the division reflects the location where the patient is having the procedure.  
-   For transfer and specialty transfer events, the division reflects the receiving location.  
*DC Reason –* The reason that this auto-DC rule will discontinue an order.  
*Excluded Display Groups –* The groups of orders (often subsets of the included packages) that are exceptions to this rule (should not cause the order to be discontinued).  
*Excluded Treating Specialties –* The specific sending and receiving specialties that are exceptions to the rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued). This prompt (field) is specific to specialty transfer events.  
*Except for Orderable Item* – An orderable item that is an exception to the rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued).  
*Except from Observation –*The field indicates whether a patient leaving an observation treating specialty should be an exception to this rule. This field is only used in discharge rules.  
**Note:** Medication orders in a “Pending” status cannot be exceptions to Auto-Discontinue rules for a Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. If this field is set to “YES” or set to “If Readmitting” and the user inputs “YES,” a pending medication order will still be Auto-Discontinued upon Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. Only medication orders in an “Active” status will be reinstated if the Except from Observation field is set to “YES” or if the user enters “YES” to the question, “Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?”  
This field can be set in the following ways:  
-   **Yes** – if you set the field to yes, a discharge from an observation treating specialty will always be an exception to this rule (should not cause an order to be discontinued).**[[^1]]**

[^1]: Except from Observation - Medication orders in a “Pending” status cannot be exceptions to Auto-Discontinue rules for a Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. If this field is set to “YES” or set to “If Readmitting” and the user inputs “YES,” a pending medication order will still be Auto-Discontinued upon Discharge from an Observation Treating Specialty. Only medication orders in an “Active” status will be reinstated if the Except from Observation field is set to “YES” or if the user enters “YES” to the question, “Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?”  
-   **No** – if you set this field to no, this rule will be applied regardless of whether the patient is discharged from an observation treating specialty.  
-   **If Readmitting** – If you set this field to If Readmitting, the user will be prompted to enter whether the patient will be immediately readmitted. If the user answers yes, the order will not be automatically discontinued. If the user answers no, the rule will be applied.**[]**  
*Inactivated –* After the date/time listed in this field, the rule will no longer be applied.  
*Included Divisions* – For multidivisional sites, the specific sending divisions that are included in this rule.  
*Included Locations –* The specific sending and receiving wards that the auto-DC rule will apply to. This prompt (field) is only used with transfer events (no specialty change).  
*MAS Movement Type* – The MAS movement type that will trigger the auto-DC rule.  
-   For a specialty transfer rule, the only movement type allowed is “Provider Specialty Change”. However, any transfer that includes a specialty change will trigger this rule, even if another movement type is entered.  
*Type of Event* – The type of event that will trigger the auto-DC rule. The value of this field can be A (admission event), T (transfer event), D (discharge event), S (specialty transfer event), or O (O. R event).  
*Type of Orders to DC* – Orders generated by the VistA package specified in this field will be discontinued.

### Files Associated with Auto-DC Rules

#### OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES (\#100.6)

This file contains the locally-defined rules that control if and when active orders are automatically discontinued within each division. It is strongly recommended that CACs use the event-delayed orders menu [OR DELAYED ORDERS] to edit this file rather than using File Manager.

## Appendix I: Event Delayed Order FAQ

1.  **Can you disable the ability to write delayed orders?**

Yes. If a user does not have any active release events he or she will not be able to write delayed orders.

1.  **Other packages (such as the Pharmacy package) have parameters that are related to events. Which parameters take precedence CPRS parameters or package parameters?**

The package parameters are evaluated first and take precedence. If you want CPRS parameters to take precedence, turn off package parameters.

1.  **Can release events be created for non-MAS events?**

Release events can be created for outpatient and other non-MAS events. However, because these types of events do not have a MAS trigger, you will have to release them manually

1.  **Some sites have created service-display groups to sort generic text orders (for example, PCA and respiratory). Are auto-DC rules related to the service or the display group?**

To identify orders, CPRS looks at the package (OE/RR for all generic orders regardless of display group). If you define the OE/RR package as an included package for auto-DC, all generic orders will be discontinued regardless of the display group. However, if the *excluded display group* field is populated, the generic orders that are associated with the display group will not be auto-discontinued.

1.  **What happens if there is an excluded orderable item identified in the auto-DC file and the orderable item is changed in the host package?**

The excluded orderable items field should not be used to specify pharmacy items that may change frequently. If the orderable item is changed, the exception will not have any effect.

1.  **Should we remove our generic “transfer to” order dialog from the add orders menus?**

Yes, remove it from your add orders menus. However, you can use the “transfer to” order dialog as the order dialog for your transfer release events. You may also use the new OR GXMOVE EVENT dialog which prompts for the release event rather than the treating specialty.

1.  **Our Chief of Surgery does not feel that “Admit to Intensive Care Surgical” is an appropriate name for a release event. She would prefer that the release event be named “Admit to Vascular Surgery Intensive Care” What do you suggest?**

You can create an “Admit to Intensive Care Surgical” release event and an “Admit to Vascular Surgery Intensive Care” child release event (or vice versa). Both of these release events would be tied to the same trigger event. When the trigger event occurred, orders tied to either of these release events would be released

1.  **Treating specialty choices are controlled by MAS. Which parameters should I look at or change to add a treating specialty?**

Facility treating specialties are usually edited by the HIMS staff. Please consult with your site staff.

1.  **A patient is transferred from a ward to O.R. to PACU to a ward. The patient is still on ward location when orders are written (e.g., patient is not transferred in the computer). How do we write orders to start in PACU?**

Create a release event called OR to PACU (of type “Surgery”). Set up a print location for each OR room and define the printer in PACU. When the OR nurse enters time out of OR, the post-op orders will release and print to PACU.

If you have other orders that need to be released when the patient goes to ward, use the manual release function.

1.  **Do surgery events auto-DC in real-time? What happens if the system is down, the surgery information is entered later, and the patient has already returned to the ward?**

Yes, surgery events auto-DC in real-time. When the system is back online, coordinate recovery efforts between surgery staff members who are backloading data and clinicians who are processing orders. If necessary, inactivate the rule while time out of OR is backloaded and then reactivate.

1.  **Can you set lapse days differently for each ward or specialty?**

Yes.

1.  **Is there a field or other identifier on the Orders tab that indicates an active order was originally entered as a delayed order?**

No; however, this information is included in the detailed order display.

1.  **Can you make an auto-DC rule that does not automatically discontinue specific generic text orders (e.g., DNR orders) and remains active throughout the patient’s hospitalizations?**

Yes, define it as an excluded orderable item in the appropriate auto-DC rule. You could also create a special display group for this type of order and then add that display group to the "excluded display group" field so that orders belonging to this display group would not be auto-discontinued.

1.  **Can MAS discontinue orders when a patient goes to surgery without a treating specialty or ward location change?**

Yes. You can define an auto-DC rule for a surgery type that will discontinue orders based on the time-out of OR.

1.  **What is the status of a delayed order that has lapsed**?

    The status will be “Lapsed.”

## Appendix K: Tracking Completed Text (Nursing) Orders

### Order Complete

There are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that need to know when certain text (nursing) orders are completed. To make this information available to both COTS or VistA packages, a new protocol has been created. The OR COMPLETE ORDER is called whenever a text (nursing) order is completed via CPRS. Any application or product that needs to be notified of complete orders may subscribe to this protocol.

The protocol is invoked for every text order when it is completed. The subscriber will have to make the decision which ones affect their application. The following information will be available for the subscribing application:

-   ORINFO(“OR0”) will be \^OR(100,ORID,0)  
-   ORINFO(“OR3”) will be \^OR(100,ORID,3)  
-   ORINFO(“OR4”) will be \^OR(100,ORID,4)  
-   ORINFO(“OR6”) will be \^OR(100,ORID,6)  
-   ORINFO(“OR7”) will be \^OR(100,ORID,7)  
-   ORINFO(“DIALOG”) will be the Order Dialog name used to create the order  
-   ORINFO(“RESPONSES) will hold the responses to the order dialog prompts (formatted as in GETDLG\^ORCD and GETORDER\^ORCD)
