## Purpose of CPRS Setup Guide

This guide is directed towards staff in IRMS and Clinical Coordinators who will be implementing the CPRS package for their local medical center.

**Post-Installation Set-up**

This guide contains instructions for setting up or editing parameters, menus, notifications, order checking, etc. It primarily focuses on CPRS core implementation (OE/RR), but it also gives a summary of set-up for the other packages interfacing within CPRS. For complete details on implementation of those packages, see their package documentation.

**Troubleshooting & Tricks**

This section contains additional information gleaned from test sites and others that may be helpful to you.

**Current Users of OE/RR 2.5**

Version 1.0 of CPRS (both the GUI and List Manager versions) requires many of the same planning and set-up steps as OE/RR 2.5. Most of the set-up applies to both user interfaces. If you implemented OE/RR 2.5, most of the work you did for 2.5 can be converted with the utilities developed for CPRS. The Pre-installation patch (OR\*2.5\*49) helps you convert menus, quick orders, and parameters for conversion.

**Sites or Services not using OE/RR 2.5**

Your site will require more preparation and setup to customize menus, protocols, quick orders, and parameters. Instructions in this manual can help you with this. You can use options on the Order Menu Management menu (distributed with the pre-installation patch, OR\*2.5\*49, or on the CPRS Configuration Menu when CPRS is installed) to begin creating menus, quick orders, and parameters.

## Overview of CPRS

CPRS provides clinicians, managers, support staff, researchers, and others an integrated patient record system. VISTA software for Pharmacy, Lab, Radiology, Allergy Tracking, Consults, Dietetics, Progress Notes, Problem List, Scheduling, MAS (A/D/T), Kernel, FileManager, Vitals, PCMM, PCE, TIU, ASU and Clinical Lexicon packages was written or modified to support and communicate with CPRS. OE/RR was completely re-written. Together, these clinical components of VISTA provide a single interface for physicians to manage patient care and records, as well as an efficient means for others to access and use patient information.

**Features:**

-   **Smooth transition from OE/RR** When a VAMC installs CPRS, a fully automated process converts existing orders, order dialogs, orderable items, medications, labs, consults, clinical notifications and other components into CPRS. No patient data is lost and little or no manual conversion is required. Installation of CPRS only requires 1-2 hours of system downtime, with little impact on users and patient care. Because of its “user-friendly” design, most VA clinicians can use CPRS with minimal training.

-   **OE/RR core module**. All basic CPRS tasks occur within the M environment. Tasks relegated to the GUI workstation include those necessary to communicate with the server and to present and obtain data. Specific components of the core M module for OE/RR include:

-   *Order processing and storage*. Processing orders in CPRS includes: 1) order dialog presentation, 2) order checking, 3) appropriate holding/processing/status assignment related to user credentials, order signature status, and filling package, 4) HL7 formatting, and 5) event posting for filling package and other interested parties, 6) receiving order status messages from filling package, and 7) updating the appropriate data files. Order storage in CPRS includes a complete, date/time-stamped history of all events related to the order including status changes, ordering, requesting, and signatory personnel, related order checks, and override reason, flagged order data, and various components related to the filling package.

-   *Mechanism for clinical orderable items*. Orderable items are phrased in physician-friendly terms, centrally stored and can be updated at individual VAMCs. Updating is coordinated between OE/RR core and ancillary packages via HL7 messages.

-   *Flagged orders*. An order can be flagged when it requires special attention. A notification regarding the flagged order is sent to appropriate caregivers assigned to the patient.

-   *Electronic signature*. Orderable items can be assigned varying degrees of electronic signature requirements. Unsigned orders trigger a notification to appropriate patient caregivers.

**CPRS Overview, cont’d**

-   *Encounter management*. Orders are linked with specific patient encounters, facilitating point-of-care management and data exchange with encounter-oriented management processes.

-   *Patient selection*. Extensive patient selection capabilities allow physicians to build patient lists based on ward, room-bed, clinic appointment, patient’s primary provider/attending physician, team and individual patient. Once created, providers’ preferred patient lists are automatically loaded when they access CPRS. For example, a provider can set up a patient list based on each day’s clinic appointments. This list is built automatically each day and displayed to facilitate easier patient selection.

-   **List Manager Interface**. Non-GUI, ANSI terminals use the CPRS List Manager interface. Designed with a great deal of clinician usability feedback, this interface displays allergies, lab results, medications, existing orders, consults, and other clinical data in a format conducive to decision making. The order entry process has been streamlined to gather the most pertinent information necessary to fill the order.

-   **GUI Interface.** Clinical workstations in the Windows environment access CPRS through a Delphi-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). Based on years of prototyping, usability studies, and actual clinical use, the CPRS GUI is a full implementation of results reporting and order entry. It communicates with CPRS server processes through the Kernel Broker client-server utility. Data is exchanged via an extensive list of remote procedure calls.

-   **HL7 Messaging/Event Processing**. Communication between VISTA packages participating in CPRS is accomplished primarily through event-driven HL7 messaging. This approach allows multiple processes to subscribe to a single CPRS event. The structure and content of the HL7 message provides consistent data for processes subscribing to an event. Additional application programmer interfaces (APIs) exist between OE/RR and ancillary packages to provide data not supported by HL7.

-   **VAMC Parameters and Defaults.** Every VAMC has specialized needs regarding CPRS functionality and processing. To allow variation and modification among VAMCs, CPRS provides a hierarchically structured set of parameters. Each parameter can have a user, team, service/section, patient location, division, system, and package value. The extensive set of parameters exported with CPRS allows VAMC administrators and CPRS users to fine-tune the functionalities and processes specific to their needs.

-   **Remote Procedure Calls.** Generically written data extraction/storage remote procedure calls (RPCs) provide access to VISTA clinical data for CPRS interfaces, VAMC-developed software, and HOST/COTS applications.

**CPRS Overview, cont’d**

-   **Consult/Request Tracking**. A fully functional consulting package is exported with CPRS. Integrated tightly with CPRS, consults provides consult ordering/requesting, tracking, and resulting. Consulting events such as requesting and resulting trigger notifications to appropriate health care providers, who can then quickly react to the request or result.

-   **Patient/Team Lists**. Patient and Team List functionality in CPRS provides several methods for linking health care providers with patients. Team relationships can be based on ward, room-bed, provider, specialty, and/or clinic. Membership is updated automatically when patients are admitted, discharged, transferred, or assigned to a clinic.

-   **Expert System**. The CPRS Expert System is a modular, rule-oriented, knowledge-based system. It supports CPRS as the basis for real-time order checking (e.g. critical drug interactions, duplicate orders) and background notifications (e.g. critical lab results, expiring medications.) Components include: a Meta-Dictionary for linking discrete medical concepts with data located in files, messages and dialogs; a Rule Editor for creating and editing medical logic modules (MLMs) or rules which relate meta-dictionary concepts in logical expressions; an Inferencing Engine for processing the rules against data; and a Router for distributing results or messages.

-   **Clinical Notifications.**  The Notifications component generates patient-specific clinical alerts regarding order entry, consult, radiology, lab, pharmacy, dietetics, and A/D/T information. Alerts are displayed to **V***IST***A** users when they sign onto the computer. They can also be delivered to printers, files, and terminals. Many alerts allow recipients to take related follow-up actions. For example, a patient’s unsigned order triggers an alert to appropriate health care providers. When a recipient selects the alert, the follow-up action displays the patient’s unsigned orders and prompts for electronic signature. Via parameters, VAMCs can disable or enable notifications for users, teams, patient locations, services, divisions, and systems.

-   **Order Checking**. Order Checks are messages interactively displayed to the ordering provider during an ordering session. They occur in real-time and are driven by responses entered by the ordering provider in conjunction with existing patient data. Order Checks are rated according to potential clinical danger level. Order check messages with a low or moderate clinical danger level can be ignored. High clinical danger level order checks require the entry of a reason if they are overridden. This information is passed on to the filling package (e.g. pharmacy) as part of the order. All order check messages include a prompt to cancel or change the order. Via parameters, VAMCs can adjust order check clinical danger levels and disable or enable order checks for users, teams, patient locations, services, divisions, and systems.

# II. Preparation & Implementation Checklist

**Recommended Pre-Installation/Implementation Activities**

**1. Facility activities before CPRS**

-   Establish CPRS Implementation committee composed of service chiefs, clinicians, Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs), upper management, and IRM

-   Create Mail Groups for CPRS Super Users, CPRS Admin., and CPRS CACs

-   Recruit a Clinical Champion who is well respected by the clinicians and who can dedicate time to CPRS activities. At both West Palm Beach and Puget Sound, the Clinical Champions assumed the “lion’s share” of the responsibility for making sure their staff were familiar with CPRS before going live.

-   Establish a schedule for CPRS Orientation Kick-Off

-   Establish a Training Schedule for CPRS Super Users and End Users

-   Establish a Training Schedule for Pharmacy Super Users and End Users

**2. Production activities before CPRS is installed into test**

-   Implement Pharmacy Data Management and TIU in Production

-   Create Mirror Image of Production Account for CPRS Test Environment

**3. Test account activities before CPRS**

-   Disable Domains that transmit data, e.g., workload transmittals, PDM transmittals

-   Review Printer set-ups; make sure that printers in patient care areas and supporting areas such as Lab and Pharmacy are NOT defined for use by applications in the test account

-   Review tasked jobs and unschedule tasks that don’t need to be run

-   Install test patches required for CPRS

-   Install OR\*2.5\*49

-   Review protocols that did not convert to Orderable Items

-   Exercise all the options introduced by OR\*2.5\*49

**Pre-Installation/Implementation Activities, cont’d**

**4. Facility Activities after CPRS is installed into test**

-   *Orient your staff to CPRS*: Use existing service meetings to discuss the impact of CPRS. For example, one of your clinical champions may want to attend the Medical Service, Surgical Service, and Ambulatory Care committee meetings to orient the clinicians to CPRS and discuss potential problems and solutions related to patient care practices and the software. West Palm Beach used those meetings to discuss CPRS and exercise the software as a group where each individual played a different role. It was really helpful in terms of making sure all aspects of the software were exercised and in establishing CPRS expertise in key clinicians, ADPACs, and CACs.

-   *Emphasize the impact of installing CPRS:* It is important that your staff understands the impact that the installation of CPRS into production will have on all the current OERR 2.5 users as well as the Outpatient and Inpatient Pharmacy users.

-   *Review site-specific menus:* Make sure that menus created specifically for your site have been reviewed and modified as needed to include CPRS options. Make sure that these changes are documented so that when CPRS is installed into production the changes can be transferred easily.

-   *Exercise every aspect of CPRS:* Make sure that all OE/RR 2.5 users have exercised CPRS functionality that relates to their work processes. Encourage them to exercise the software for at least 4 hours.

-   *Assign individuals to become experts in CPRS functional areas*:

1.  **Time Delay Orders**

    Establish a good understanding of how time-delayed orders are placed and activated

2.  **Transfer Inpatient Medication Orders to Outpatient Medication Orders**

    Establish a good understanding of how orders are transferred from inpatient to outpatient and vice versa.

-   *Establish consistent use of the software:* Not everyone in the medical center uses the software the same way. For instance, in one service a consult may be considered complete after the physician in the receiving service sees the patient and enters a result. In another service the request may be considered complete if the patient was given a scheduled appointment. Many of these things are process issues, but they need to be tested in each specialty, to make sure everyone is using the same rulebook.

-   *Review Clinical Practices and Administrative Process Work Flows:* Ensure that patient care practices that are specific to your site are carefully reviewed and tested/implemented via CPRS functionality.

**Pre-Installation/Implementation Activities, cont’d**

#### 

*Collect several charts from selected clinical areas*

-   Replicate the ordering process as noted in those charts in CPRS

-   Note timeliness, optimal menus, user configurations, print features, displays etc.

-   Modify the software configurations to accommodate these user groups/clinical areas

-   Save your discoveries for configuring the production account

**5. Facility activities two weeks before CPRS is installed into production**

-   *Alert all CPRS users*: At least one-two weeks before your production installation date, remind your CPRS users that CPRS is coming and that they need to be familiar with the software functionality that will impact them. Offer additional training classes. West Palm Beach administered competency tests to all their users to assess their understanding of how the software functions. An example of a competency test is included with this checklist.

-   *Modify your computer sign-on bulletin*: Consider adding a statement to your computer sign-on bulletin one week before CPRS is installed, informing users that CPRS is coming. Include the scheduled CPRS installation time as well as the expected downtime. We recommend that you consider installing CPRS around 8:00pm on a Friday and plan for at least 2-3 hours downtime.

-   *Create a schedule of patient care areas where CPRS will be implemented:* Create a schedule assigning Super Users and CACs to patient care areas during the first week of CPRS implementation. Staff will need to be scheduled for every shift on every patient care location. You will also need to create an on-call schedule for the most experienced users, e.g., your CACs. Include in that list one or more clinicians who are experts in the software.

-   *Create a protocol for obtaining CPRS help:* During the first week of implementation, it is common for users who are not familiar with CPRS to get lost in the software. Create a protocol for obtaining CPRS help and distribute it to all CPRS Users.

-   *Identify patient care areas that may be problematic:* Avoid potential disasters in patient care areas that require special considerations by anticipating problems and identifying solutions before CPRS is implemented.

**Pre-Installation/Implementation Activities, cont’d**

#### 

-   *Assign installation/implementation responsibilities to staff:* Identify which staff will be available for the installation and what their responsibilities will be related to parameter review, printer set-up reviews, exercising the software, and patient care area patrols.

-   *Assign a CPRS Command Center Coordinator:* Identify the individual at your site who will be the responsible individual at the CPRS Command Center. This individual will need to have a complete understanding of all CPRS functionality and will need to know your staff and the unique problems that could be encountered.

**IRM Activities Just Before CPRS is Installed**

-   *Read the CPRS Installation and Setup Guides:* Make sure you have thoroughly read the CPRS Installation Guide and the CPRS Setup Guide several days before your installation date. Resolve any questions that arise.

-   *Back up your system:* Make a backup of your system no later than the day before you install CPRS.

-   *Ensure that you have adequate disk space:* Make sure you have at least 300-400 mg free disk space before installing CPRS.

-   *Ensure that you have adequate journal space:* Make sure you have adequate journal space available to enable journaling after CPRS is installed. The conversion will continue for approximately 24 – 48 hours after CPRS is installed. You will need to monitor your journal space during the time that the conversion is running.

-   *XQALERT DELETE OLD--Delete Old (\>14 d) Alerts:* Make sure you schedule this option to run daily. If Notifications/Alerts are enabled through CPRS, the \^XTV global will experience a significant growth. Ensuring that this option is run on a daily basis will manage the growth of \^XTV.

-   *Establish downtime procedures:* When CPRS is installed, plan for at least 2-3 hours of downtime. Advise your users and establish downtime procedures.

-   *Allocate OE/RR keys to new CPRS users:* Allocate OE/RR keys to CPRS users who weren’t OE/RR 2.5 users. CPRS uses the same keys as OE/RR 2.5.

D. Other CPRS Configuration

1.  List Manager Terminal Settings  
1.  Nature of Order File  
## A. OE/RR-CPRS Clean-up  
***

We recommend cleaning up and re-setting various files, menus, and parameters before beginning to use CPRS.  
***

**1. CPRS Clean-up Utilities Menu**  
***

The Lab Order Checks options on this menu are used to check and clean up some files as you move from OE/RR 2.5 to CPRS.  
***

**2. Alerts**  
***

Clean up old alerts, either through the option Erase Notifications [ORB3 ERASE NOTIFICATIONS] or by running the Kernel utility XQALERT DELETE OLD.  
*Erase Notifications* lets you do one of the following:  
1\. Erase all notifications for a User

2\. Erase all notifications for a Patient

3\. Erase all instances of a notification (regardless of patient).  
The XQALERT DELETE OLD option can be queued to run regularly. You can set the number of days an alert is held with the option *Archive(delete) after \<x\> Days [ORB3 ARCHIVE PERIOD*] on the Notification Mgmt Menu*.* You can also designate that alerts be forwarded to a surrogate or supervisor after a certain number of days.

Because this option cleans up old alerts (the archives are still kept), it should be run daily/nightly.  
**3. Patient Lists**  
***

Review patient and team lists set up at your hospital to determine if they are all being used, or if some could be combined.  
***

**4. Lab pending orders**  
***

Go through lab orders, especially those with statuses of pending, to see if these are still active orders. Lab doesn't purge old orders as many packages do. At test sites, many inactive lab orders were shown as pending, which caused problems. Clean up your records by discontinuing lab orders you don’t need.  
***

**5. Ward and clinic names**  
***

You may want to rename wards and clinics if you have defined a lot of wards and clinics, especially if many begin with the same standard identifiers.

*Examples:*

ATC/AL Dual Dx Gr

ATC/AL Dual Dx Indiv

ATC/AL Dual Dx Int Outpt Gp

It’s hard to do look-ups on this kind of naming system.  
**6. Consults**  
***

If you had consults categorized as Progress Notes before the Consult/ Request Tracking link to TIU, you may want to delete these if you create new Document Classes and Titles for Consults.  
## B. CPRS Configuration (Clinical Coordinator)

The options and functionality described in this section are in alphabetical order, as listed on the Clinical Coordinator’s CPRS Configuration menu.

### 2. Key Assignment and Electronic Signature Set-up

**Allocate CPRS Security Keys**

The ORES, ORELSE, and OREMAS keys deal with authorization for writing orders. More than one of them should not be assigned to the same user.

**ORES**

-   Assigned to users authorized to write and sign orders.

-   Typically assigned to licensed physician.

-   Allows holders to electronically sign orders.

    **ORELSE**

-   Assigned to users authorized to release physician’s orders.

-   Typically assigned to RN’s.

    **OREMAS**

-   Assigned to users authorized to release patient orders as signed on chart.

-   Typically assigned to Ward Clerks.

**ORSUPPLY**

-   Assigned to users authorized to write and release Supply-only orders.

-   Typically assigned to Nurses who are not currently AUTHORIZED TO WRITE MED ORDERS.

### Electronic Signature

An electronic signature is the private code that an authorized user types into the system after performing certain actions. For CPRS, it’s used by clinicians entering orders. This signature has the same validity as the written signature on the chart.

Implementing electronic signature for CPRS is a four-step process:

1\. Define the clinician as a provider in the NEW PERSON file.

2\. Assign the clinician the Provider key (while in the NEW PERSON file).

2\. Assign the ORES key to clinicians who have signature authority.

3\. Assign electronic signature codes (this can be done by the coordinator, at the same time as defining the clinician as a provider in the NEW PERSON file, or by the clinician, using *Electronic Signature Code Edit* on the User’s Toolbox menu. See instructions on following pages).

Users may have the ORES key but not have an electronic signature code, and will, therefore, not be allowed to electronically sign orders on the system.

☞**NOTE**: Until ORES key holders have an electronic signature code, the system assumes that orders entered have been entered and manually signed “on chart”; orders are automatically released to the ancillary service for action.

Once ORES key holders have an electronic signature code, they will be prompted to enter the electronic signature after accepting the orders. If the electronic signature code is entered correctly, the orders are released to the ancillary services for action. If the electronic signature code is not entered, or is entered incorrectly, the orders are *not* released to the ancillary services for action, but are held in an unreleased/unsigned status. Key holders are given three chances to correctly enter their signature codes.

**GUI Review and Sign works as follows, according to signature status:**

**User has provider key only (med student):** If there are notes the user can sign, the ES panel appears in Review/Sign Changes; otherwise it is hidden. Orders appear on the list with the checkbox grayed. If the ES is entered for documents, it is NOT applied to the orders.

**User has OREMAS key:** If users (clerks) have entered notes for which they are the author AND orders on behalf of a provider, TWO review screens will appear⎯one prompting for ES for the things the clerk can sign (a note), and one to allow the clerk to process the orders (mark signed on chart).

**User has ORELSE key:** Works the same as for clerks, but the user can also release the orders.

**User has ORES key:** Sees the review screen with the ES prompting, both for notes and orders.

**Note:** Outpatient med orders cannot be released to pharmacy unless an authorized provider signs the order. Verbal, telephoned, and written orders are no longer accepted.

**Electronic Signature Edit option**

Key holders may enter or edit their electronic signature codes through the option, “Electronic Signature Edit,” on the User’s Toolbox menu. To change an existing code, the user must type in the current code and then enter the new one.

**Set-up of Electronic Signature**

If key holders forget their electronic signature codes, they must contact their IRM Service so that the old code can be deleted. Once this has been done, the user will be allowed to enter a new code without having to know the old code. IRM staff can delete the electronic signature code by editing the field, ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CODE (20.4) in the NEW PERSON file (200), or by using the option, “Clear Electronic Signature Code [XUSESIG CLEAR].”

**Allocate CPRS Security Keys**

1\. Assign the appropriate keys to the appropriate users, using the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) option, *Allocate CPRS Security Keys*.

2\. Users add their signature codes through the option, *Electronic Signature Code Edit,* on the User’s Toolbox menu. Users with the ORES key will not see the electronic signature prompts until they do this.

If the ORES key holder hits Enter at the electronic signature prompt (in the List Manager version of CPRS), this dialogue appears:

You did not enter a signature code!  
...orders requiring signature will be marked as 'SIGNED ON CHART'.  
***

Once ORES keyholders add their signature codes, they will see:

To electronically sign these orders...  
Enter Signature Code: (xxxxxxx) \<hidden\>  
SIGNED  
4\. Users with the ORELSE and OREMAS keys will see the following prompts after entering orders:

Select Action: Accept Orders// **\<Enter\>** Accept Orders  
***

### 4. GUI Setup

**Required Files:**

CPRSChart.exe CPRS executable

CPRS.hlp CPRS help file

HOSTS should reside on the client already

**Steps for setting up the CPRS GUI**

**a.**  Assign OR CPRS GUICHART as a secondary menu item to anyone who will be using the GUI.

**b.** Make sure servers are listed in the HOSTS file. If necessary, modify the HOSTS file of each client (PC) to set the appropriate mappings between names and IP addresses. The HOSTS file is located as follows:

| **Version of Windows OS** | **File (Location and Name)**               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Windows 95                | C:\\WINDOWS\\HOSTS                         |
| Windows NT 3.51           | C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS\\ETC\\HOSTS |
| Windows NT 4.0            | C:\\WINNT\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS\\ETC\\HOSTS   |

**Example of a Windows 95 HOSTS file**  
\# Copyright (c) 1994 Microsoft Corp.  
\#  
\# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Chicago  
\#  
\# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each  
\# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should  
\# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.  
\# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one  
\# space.  
\#  
\# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual  
\# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '\#' symbol.  
\#  
\# For example:  
\#  
\# 102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com \# source server  
\# 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com \# x client host  
\#  
1) Move the cursor to the end of the last line displayed in the file.

2) Press the Enter Key to create a new line.

3) On the new line, enter the desired IP address beginning in the first column, as described in the example above. As recommended, add an appropriate IP address for the DHCPSERVER Host name as the next entry below 127.0.0.1.

3) After typing the IP address, type at least one space, and enter the Host name that corresponds to that IP address. As recommended, type in DHCPSERVER as the next entry below “loopback.”

For example, the entry for a server at your site with an IP address of 192.1.1.1 would look like this:

127.0.0.1 localhost \# loopback **\<---existing entry**  
192.1.1.1 DHCPSERVER \# cprs **\<---added entry**  
4) Repeat steps a - d until you have entered all of the IP addresses and corresponding Host names you wish to enter.

5) When your entries are complete, use Notepad's **File \| Save** command to save the HOSTS file.

** NOTE:** *Do not save the HOSTS file with an extension; delete the .sam!*

6) Close the HOSTS file.

** NOTE:** The HOSTS file location on NT 4.0 Client is different from on WIN95. The CPRS executable attempts⎯using RPC Broker⎯to log in to the default DHCP server when CPRS executes. RPC Broker cannot find the HOSTS file, so it uses the default.

The best workaround is to create a shortcut to the CPRS executable on your PC:

-   right click on the executable icon

-   select “Properties”

-   add s="your server name" p="your listener port" after the .exe command

    For more information, see the *RPC Broker V.1.1 Systems Manual*.

    **c**. Copy the file CPRSChart1.0.exe and CPRS.hlp to the workstations or put the files in a shared directory on the network. Rename CPRSChart1.0.exe to CPRSChart.

    **d**. **(optional)** If desired, you can either create a shortcut or an icon for CPRSChart or add it to the Start menu.

2\. Use *Edit Parameter Values*, select ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST.

3\. Select "System" to enter the dialogs and menus that you want to appear in the list at your site.

**Using Order Menu Management - Enter/edit order menus on the CPRS configuration menu (Clin Coord).**

1\. Create a new menu. Remember, this menu will be what shows up in the list box on the left side of the orders tab, so it should be a single column. You can put what you want in this list. The idea was that it would contain the most common ordering menus and dialogs to which a user needs access.

2\. After creating the menu, use *Edit Parameter Values* and select ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST as the parameter.

3\. Select "System" and enter the menu you just created as the value. You can override by exception what you set for the system level by setting the parameter for a particular division or user. The ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter takes precedence over the ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter, if both are present.

You can find what was on the "Write Orders" list to start with by using the parameter tools menu (XPAR MENU TOOLS), selecting List Values for a selected parameter, and entering ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST as the parameter. The exported list will be preceded by PKG. If the list has been modified at your site, each item will be preceded by SYS. If a list has been set up for a specific user, it will be preceded by USR.

The "Write Orders" list, as exported, contains the following dialogs:

Sequence Value Display Name  
30 FHW1 Diet  
52 PSJ OR PAT OE Meds, Inpatient  
55 PSO OERR Meds, Outpatient  
58 PSJI OR PAT FLUID OE IV Fluids

70 RA OERR EXAM Radiology  
80 GMRCOR CONSULT Consult  
85 GMRCOR REQUEST Procedure  
90 GMRVOR Vitals  
99 OR GXTEXT WORD PROCESSING ORDER Text Only Order  
The sequence is just an arbitrary number to indicate the order that the dialog should be in the list.

### Document Templates

With the CPRS GUI, you can create document templates to make writing or editing progress notes, completing consults, or writing discharge summaries quicker and easier. In addition, you can import or export templates and convert Microsoft Word files to document templates.  
**Template Editor**  
The Template Editor is used to create and manage document templates. To access the Template Editor select **Options \| Create New Template…**from the Notes, Consults, or D/C Summ tab.**  
**  
![The Template editor dialog enables users to create templates that they can user to create documents. There are several different kinds of templates, some for simply organizing and others that have dialogs associated with them.](a7c969662b0af6aa15524928e64c87f7.png)

The Template Editor window  
For an explanation of the icons used in the Template Editor, select **Tools** \| **Template Icon Legend** and click the **Templates** tab.   
  
![The Reminders icon legend](e8c9f7d790d30b24491957f0ea6a0f80.png)  
The Icon Legend

**Personal and Shared Templates**  
You can create and use your own templates or you can use shared templates created by your Clinical Coordinator.  
**Personal Templates**  
Authorized users can create personal templates. You can copy and paste text into a template, type in new content, add template fields, or copy a shared template into your personal templates folder. A shared template that you simply copy into your personal templates folder without changing continues to be updated whenever the original template is changed or modified in the Shared Templates folder. Once you personalize or change the copy of the shared template in your personal templates field, the icon used to represent it changes and it becomes a personal template. From that moment on, the personal template is not related to the shared template and is not updated with the original. In the tree view, personal template and folder icons have a folded upper right corner.  
**Shared Templates.**  
Only members of the Clinical Coordinator Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU) class can create shared templates. Shared templates are available to all users. Clinical Coordinators can copy and paste text into a template, type in new content, add Template Fields, or copy a personal template and then modify it as needed. In the tree view, shared template and folder icons do not have a folded corner.  
**Note**: When you install CPRS, a copy of all your existing boilerplate titles is placed in the inactive boilerplates folder under shared templates.  
Clinical Coordinators can arrange the boilerplate titles that have been copied into the shared templates, use them to create new shared templates, or make them available to users by moving them out of the inactive boilerplates folder. Users will not see the inactive boilerplates folder or its templates unless you choose to make the folder active.  
**To activate the boilerplates folder, Clinical Coordinators should follow these steps:**  
1.  Open the Templates Editor.  
1.  Verify that Edit Shared Templates is checked.  
1.  Uncheck Hide Inactive (under shared templates).  
1.  Click the plus sign beside the shared icon.  
Shared Templates includes a lock property that prevents users from making personal changes when it has been set. The status of the lock property is displayed in a check box on the Template Editor dialog. When the Shared Templates root template is locked, no shared templates can be modified.  
For more information on boilerplates, refer to the *Text Integration Utility User Manual*.  
Another area of shared templates is creating Patient Data Object templates for newly created TIU objects that will enable users to place these objects into their other templates.  
**To create a new Patient Data Object template, use the following steps:**  
1.  Open the Template Editor by selecting from the Notes, Consults, or DC/Summ tab by selecting **Options \| Edit Shared Templates…**.

2.  Verify that Edit Shared Templates is checked.

3.  Expand the treeview of Shared Templates and then Patient Data Objects by clicking on the plus sign beside each.

4.  Click on the existing object above which you want your new object to be.

5.  Click New Template and edit the name of the template.

6.  Place the cursor in the Template Boilerplate box and select Edit \| Insert Patient Data Object or right-click and select Insert Patient Data Object to bring up a dialog containing a list of TUI objects.

7.  Click the appropriate TIU object (that was probably just created).

8.  Click **Apply** or **OK** to make the new object available in GUI templates.  
**Mark a Template as Default**  
A default template will automatically be selected the first time you open the Templates Drawer. The default template can also be accessed at any time with the Go to Default Template option. Each tab (Notes, Consults, and D/C Summ) can have its own default templates.

**To set a template as your default template, follow these steps:**  
1.  Open the Template Drawer on the Notes tab by clicking on it.  
    The available templates will be displayed in a tree view.  
1.  Right-click on any template and select Mark as Default from the right-click menu.  
![Users can open the Templates drawer on the Notes tab and use the predefined items there to complete their progress notes. This screen shot also shows a right-click dialog that is available when clicking on the items in the Tempates drawer.](623354dbfb720274c9b079a7d95e4152.png)

You can set a template as your default template with a right click menu option.

**Hide Child Templates**  
**To make child templates unavailable from the template drawer, follow these steps:**  
1.  Start the Template Editor by selecting **Options** \| **Edit Templates** from the Notes tab.  
1.  Click Hide Dialog Items from the Dialog Properties option group.  
1.  Click **OK**.  
**Display Only**  
Click this check box to make individual parts of a dialog as display only. When a template is display only, the check box is removed and the item is used for information or instructions  
***

**Only Show First Line**  
Click on this check box and the template will display only the first line of text followed by an ellipsis (...). The ellipsis indicates that more text exists. Hold the cursor over the line of text and a Hint box displays the complete text. This feature gives you the ability to have long paragraphs of text that do not take up a lot of room on the template. If selected, the entire paragraph is be inserted into the note.  
***

**Indent Dialog Items**  
Clicking on this check box affects the way that children items are displayed on the template. When selected, this feature gives the ability to show hierarchical structure in the dialog. All of the subordinate items for the selected item are indented.  
**One Item Only**  
Clicking on this check box affects the way that children items are displayed on the template. Click on this check box if you want to allow only one of the subordinate items to be selectable. Clicking on this check box changes the check boxes into radio buttons so that only one item can be selected at a time. To deselect all items, click on the one that is selected and the radio button will be cleared.  
***

**Hide Dialog Items**  
Clicking on this check box affects the way that children items are displayed on the template. Click on this option to have subordinate items appear only if the parent item is selected. This feature allows for custom user input. The user only sees the options related to the items selected. This feature requires boilerplated text at the parent level.  
***

**Allow Long Lines**  
*A check box in the Template Editor named “Allow Long Lines” allows template lines to be up to 240 characters in length. This feature mainly accommodates template field markup.*

**Types of Templates**  
When you create templates, you can go directly into the Template Editor. There, you can type in text, and add Template Fields. If you are in a document and type in something you will use repeatedly, you simply select that text, right-click, select Create New Template, and the editor comes up with the selected text in the editing area. You can create individual templates, group templates, dialog templates, folders, or link templates to Reminder dialogs. Template dialogs are resizable.  
***

**Templates**  
Templates contain text, TIU objects, and Template Fields that you can place in a document.  
***

**Group Templates**  
Group templates contain text and TIU objects and can also contain other templates. If you place a group template in a document, all text and objects in the group template and all the templates it contains (unless they are excluded from the group template) will be placed in the document. You can also expand the view of the group template and place the individual templates it contains in a document one at a time.  
***

**Dialog Templates**  
Dialog templates are like group templates in that they contain other templates. You can place a number of other templates under a dialog template. Then, when you drag the dialog template into your document, a dialog appears that has a checkbox for each template under the Dialog template. The person writing the document can check the items they want and click OK to place them in the note.  
**Folders**  
Folders are used to group and organize templates and assist in navigating the template tree view. For example, you could create a folder called "radiology" for all of the templates relating to radiology.  
**Reminder Dialog**  
Reminder dialogs can be linked to templates. This allows you to place orders and enter PCE information, vitals information, and mental health data from a template. (Refer to Creating Reminder Dialogs for this procedure.)  
**Arranging Templates for Ease of Use**  
You can use file cabinets and folders to group similar templates together to make them easier to find and use. For example, you may want to place all of the pulmonary templates together rather than listing the templates in alphabetical order.  
**Adding a Template to a Note**  
**To add a template to a Note, use the following steps:**  
1.  From the Notes tab, create a new note by clicking on **New Note**.  
1.  Complete the Progress Note Properties dialog.  
1.  Click **OK**.  
    The Progress Note Properties dialog will close and the Templates Drawer will appear above the Reminder Drawer.

You can also move the template by using the arrows below the personal templates tree view.)  
1.  Click **Apply** to save the template.  
1.  Click **OK** to save and exit the editor.  
**Note**: You are not required to click Apply after each template, but it is recommended. If you click Cancel, you will lose all changes you have made since the last time you clicked Apply or OK.

These folders allow you to associate a template with a progress note title, a procedure, or a type of consult. After an association is created, the appropriate template content is inserted in either the body of a note (when a new note is started) or in the Reason for Request field (when a new consult or procedure is ordered).  
**To associate a template with a document title, type of consult, or a procedure, follow these steps:**

1.  Select a procedure from the Associated Procedure drop-down list   
    \-or-  
    select a consult service from the Associated Consult Service drop-down list.  
1.  Click **OK**.  
    The template is now associated.  
When you order a consult or a procedure, the associated template text will appear in the Reason for Request field. When you enter a new progress note the associated template text will appear in the text of the note.  
**Importing a Document Template**  
You can import existing template files (.txml), Microsoft Word files (Word 97 or higher), or XML files into the CPRS Template Editor.  
To import a template, follow these steps:

2.  Browse to the file cabinet or folder where you would like to store the imported template (click “+” to expand a heading).

    **Note**: In order to import a template to the Shared Templates area of the screen, you must be authorized to edit shared temples *and* place a checkmark in the Edit Shared Templates check box (located in the lower left side of the Template Editor).  
1.  Select Tools \| Import Template.

2.  Select the file you would like to import and click Open.

3.  The template will appear in the Template Editor.

**Template Fields**  
Template fields allow you to create text edit boxes and lists of text that can be selected via combo boxes, buttons, check boxes, or radio buttons. Through a new type of markup syntax {FLD:TemplateFieldName}, these controls can be added to templates, boilerplate titles, boiler plate reasons for request, and reminder dialogs. A Template field editor has also been added that can be used by members of the ASU user classes listed in the new TIU FIELD EDITOR CLASSES parameter. You can access the template field editor through the options menu on Notes, Consults and D/C Summaries tabs, as well as through the new Template Editor Tools menu. There is also a new Insert Template Field menu option in the Template Editor, following the Insert Patient Data Object menu option. You can enter free text into Template Field Combo boxes.  
Template Dialogs will now show an asterisk ( \* ) before required template fields, and will not allow you to press the OK button if you have not completed the required fields. A message has also been added at the bottom of the template dialogs that states "\* Indicates a Required Field.”  
***

Template Fields can also be used in boilerplate text that can be associated to a new Note, Consult, or Discharge Summary.

You can use the Preview button to preview a template dialog.  
**Using the Template Field Editor**  
You can reduce the time required to complete a note, consult, or discharge summary by adding template fields to your templates and dialogs. Information that you would normally have to look up can be pulled directly into your note, consult, or discharge summary from the template fields in your templates.  
**To view the predefined characteristics of the template fields:**

If Edit Box is selected, type or select a number between 1 and 70 into the Maximum Number of Characters field. If Combo Box, Button, Check Boxes or Radio Buttons are selected as the Type, the Default field and Maximum Number of Characters fields are unavailable. The Items field and the Default field below Items are active.  
The Default field below the Type field is available only when Edit Box is the Type selected. Type the text that you wish to have appears in the Edit Box by default. On the template, the user can accept the default text or change it, as long as the new text is within the Maximum Number of Characters limit.  
***

If the Type is Combo Box, Button, Check Boxes, or Radio Buttons, the Items field will be active. Type the different choices from which you wish to let the user choose. Each item must be on a separate line in the Items field. However, if you wish to have the Items listed on separate lines in the template, you must enable the Separate Lines check box.  
If the Type is Combo Box, Button, Check Boxes, or Radio Buttons, the second Default field will be active. If you wish, you may click the drop-down button and select one of the items as the default.  
***

If you wish, you may type text in the LM Text field and it will appear in the List Manager version. Template Fields have been developed strictly for GUI functionality. If you are still using LM, the text {FLD:TEMPLATE FIELD NAME} will appear in LM body of the note. To avoid this, type text in this field.  
***

If the field being created on the template is required, enable the Required check box, which will prevent the template from being closed without the field being selected or completed.  
You may include text in the Notes field that will explain or describe the Template Field. You may also use it to record changes that have been made to the Template field. The text typed into this field will not appear on the template. These notes will not appear to a user when entering a note. They are for development use only as notes to the creator.  
Click Preview to see how the Template Field will appear on a template or click OK to complete the procedure.  
**Inserting Template Fields into a Template**  
Once you have decided which Template fields to use or you have defined the Template Field that you need, you can add them into a template. With the Template field in the Template, you can quickly and easily select the items you wish to add to a note, consult or discharge summary.  
**To add a Template Field into a Template:**

### 6. Notifications

##### Overview

The Notifications component in CPRS generates clinical alerts regarding patient information from DHCP packages such as CPRS, Lab, Radiology, and Consults. A notification consists of one line of text that is displayed to the user at sign-on and option prompts.

CPRSUSER,EIGHT (T2342): New order(s) placed.  
CPRSPROVIDER,FOUR (A3456): Order requires electronic signature.  
CPRSUSER,TEN (A4321): Medication order(s) unverified by nurse.  
CPRSUSER1,ONE (N4723): Medications nearing expiration.  
Some notifications allow the user to perform a follow-up action to the notification. Notifications are deleted after being displayed and/or a follow-up action is taken. Sites have control over the use of CPRS Notifications at their Medical Centers. Kernel utilities handle the display, deletion, and follow-up actions for CPRS Notifications.

CPRS Notifications furnish providers with timely feedback regarding clinically relevant events. Some notifications allow the notification recipient to take direct follow-up action to the clinically relevant event.

The Team List utility (discussed in the next section) is used by the Notification utility to help identify potential notification recipients.

**Setup**  
To initiate notifications after the CPRS installation is complete, do the following steps:  
**a. Enable Notifications, as needed by your site.** Notifications are exported as disabled to allow the conversions and install to run more rapidly. To enable Notifications, use the Notification Mgmt Menu for CPRS Mgr [ORB NOT MGR MENU] under the CPRS Configuration Menu (Clin Coord), then pick *Enable or Disable Notification System* If your site is multidivisional, you can enable or disable the system for each division. If it isn’t, or you want to enable for all divisions at once, select “System.” For each division or the system enter “Enable” at the value prompt.

**The new notifications that didn’t exist in OE/RR 2.5 are exported as “disabled.” This allows you to review and enable new notifications as needed by your site. Early installations of CPRS with all new notifications enabled tended to overwhelm users. Therefore, we recommend that you enable the new notifications for a few users at a time or a ward/clinic/service-section at a time.**  
***

**b. Use the options on the Notification Management Menu to control the way notifications work for individuals, departments/services, or the entire medical center. (These options are described in following pages.)**  
***

**c. Edit Site Local Terms**

After CPRS installation, each site must run this option to link terms used in the expert system to local terms. Some terms like DNR and NPO diet must be mapped to one or more entries in the orderable item file. Other terms like Serum Creatinine must be mapped to the lab test file.

**Clean-up of OE/RR 2.5 Alerts**

Some active notifications are converted to information-only alerts when CPRS 1.0 is installed, because CPRS no longer supports their follow-up action. The following alerts are converted:

Lab Results

Flagged Orders

Order Requiring Electronic Signature (Unsigned Orders)

Abnormal Lab Results

Critical Lab Results

Lab critical/abnormal/new result

Unsigned Progress Notes

Progress Notes Require Co-signature

**Notifications, cont’d**

The following alerts are now handled by TIU functionality and are no longer triggered by CPRS:

Unsigned Progress Note

Progress Note Requires Co-signature

The following alerts are supported by CPRS and will not be converted:

Radiology Results

Abnormal Radiology Results

Radiology Request Cancel/Held

Consult/Request Cancel/Held

New Service Consult/Request

**☞ NOTE:** Please notify your users that the above-mentioned alerts will be converted during install to make way for the new alerts and functionality of CPRS:

This is what the newly converted alerts will look like:

[CONV] CPRSUSER1,TWO (O6641): Order requires electronic signature.  
[CONV] CPRSUSER1,THREE(A8900): LAB Critical GLUC.:NA:K:CA:PO4:URIC AC:...  
[CONV] CPRSUSER1,FOUR (S5293): Orders needing clarification.  
**Lab Alert Changes**

The lab series of alerts have been altered to work in conjunction as follows:

1\. Users who work from lab results should have the Lab Results alert enabled and the Abnormal Lab Results alerts disabled.

2\. Users (most clinicians) should enable one of the Abnormal Lab Results alerts and disable the Lab Results alert.

3\. The Critical Lab Results alert [Info] is usually mandatory and sent to everyone linked to the patient or the order.

4\. Abnormal Lab Results [Action], Critical Lab Result [Action], and Lab Results have follow-up actions that show the results of the order for abnormal/critical tests and normal tests. For most users, they should have one of these alerts enabled but not both.

5\. Abnormal Lab Result [Info] and Critical Lab Result [Info] display the result and collection date/time in the message and have no follow-up.

With these alerts, users can get alerts for all or abnormal lab results, then see the actual results of the order via follow-up action. To supplement this, critical lab results are displayed.

**Notifications, cont’d**

**Notification Processing**

A particular notification can be enabled (set to “Mandatory”) or disabled by Users, Clinical Coordinators, or IRMS staff. Clinical Coordinators or IRMS staff can make a notification mandatory by setting its value to “Mandatory.” This is accomplished by using options on the Notifications Management Menus. For example, the notification LAB RESULTS is exported as “disabled.” A site may want to “enable” this notification. Once enabled, the LAB RESULTS notification will be sent to all appropriate users.

Notifications are deleted after being selected in the VIEW ALERTS option and/or a follow-up action is taken.

**Notifications recipients**

-   Ordering clinician/provider

-   Members of a defined team related to the ordering clinician/ provider (Order Requires Electronic Signature and Order Requires Co-Signature notifications only)

-   Providers with the notification patient on one or more of their patient lists (personal or team)

-   Patient’s attending physician

-   Patient’s primary provider

    **When Notifications can be seen**

-   When you sign onto the system.

-   After you reach a menu display and are prompted to “Select OPTION:” This includes notifications occurring since the last time you were at a “Select OPTION” prompt.

-   If you select “VIEW ALERTS” at any “Select OPTION” prompt.

-   In Windows (GUI) when you select a new patient.

    **Notification Actions**

-   Some Notifications are information-only and disappear after you select them.

-   Other Notifications require a follow-up action before they are removed. The follow-up action takes you to a screen to perform the desired action.

-   To review notifications and/or take follow-up action, select the VIEW ALERTS option, and enter the number(s) of the notification(s) you wish to process. You can also enter the following:

    A to process all of the pending alerts in the order shown.

    I to process all of the INFORMATION ONLY alerts, if any

    P to print a copy of the pending alerts on a printer

    M to receive a MailMan message containing a copy of these pending alerts

    F to Forward alerts

    R to Redisplay the available alerts

**Notifications Management Menu Option Descriptions**

**Enable/Disable Notifications [ORB3 PROCESSING FLAG]**

This option allows a coordinator or user to turn specific notifications on or off.

E (Enabled): notification enabled for entity unless entity of higher precedence has notification disabled (e.g. Enabled at System level and Disabled at User level - User will not receive notification.)

D (Disabled): notification disabled for entity unless entity of higher precedence has notification enabled (see the Recipient Matrix) (e.g. Disabled at System level and Enabled at User level - User will receive notification.)

**☞ NOTE**: If a coordinator or IRMS person has answered “Yes” in the option *Set Default Recipients for Notification,* indicating that the user should *always* receive the notification, that Team or User will always receive the notification, regardless of the Enabled/Disabled settings.

**Disabling a Notification**  
Disabling a notification follows the same process, but it seems counter-intuitive. When the program asks if you want to add a new Notification, logically you’d want to say “No,” but the program is really asking if you want to add a new notification to a temporary list for consideration about enabling or disabling. The program is using a generic FileMan call⎯we hope that in the near future a more user-friendly utility will be written for this option.

**Erase Notifications [ORB3 ERASE NOTIFICATIONS]**  
This option allows you to do one of the following:

1\. Erase all notifications for a User

2\. Erase all notifications for a Patient

3\. Erase all instances of a notification (regardless of Patient or User)

**Set Urgency for Notifications (GUI) [ORB3 URGENCY]**

This option lets you set the Urgency for a notification. The urgency is mainly used for sorting in GUI displays. The Urgencies include:

1.  (High): notification is Highly urgent.

2.  (Moderate): notification is Moderately urgent.

3.  (Low): notification is of Low urgency.

    **Set Deletion Parameters for Notifications [ORB3 DELETE MECHANISM]**  
This option lets you set parameters to determine deletion conditions.

It uses a set of codes to determine how a notification will be deleted at a site. The codes include:

**I** (Individual Recipient): delete the notification for an individual recipient when:

a) that individual completes the follow-up action on notifications with associated follow-up action.

b) that individual reviews notifications without follow-up actions.

**Notifications, cont’d**

**A** (All Recipients): delete the notification for all recipients when:

1.  any recipient completes the follow-up action on notifications with follow-up actions.

2.  any recipient reviews notifications without follow-up actions.

    **Set Default Recipient(s) for Notifications [ORB3 DEFAULT RECIPIENTS]**  
Enter “Yes” if the recipient should always receive this notification. Recipients (users, teams) will receive the notification on a regular basis⎯despite settings in the option Enable/Disable Notifications. These recipients will always receive the notification, regardless of patient.

**Set Default Recipient Device(s) for Notifications [ORB3 DEFAULT DEVICE RECIPIENTS]**

Enter “Yes” if the device (from the Device file) should always receive this notification. Recipient devices will receive the notification on a regular basis⎯despite settings in the option Enable/Disable Notifications. These recipient devices will always receive the notification, regardless of patient.

**Set Provider Recipients for Notifications [ORB3 PROVIDER RECIPIENTS]**  
This option lets you set any one or combination of a set of codes indicating default [provider] recipients of a notification by their title or relationship to the patient. Notifications can be set up with any or all of the following codes:

P (Primary Provider): deliver notification to the patient’s Inpatient Primary Provider.  
A (Attending Physician): deliver notification to the patient's Attending Physician  
T (Patient Care Team): deliver notification to the patient's primary care Team.  
O (Ordering Provider): deliver notification to the provider who placed the order that triggered the notification.  
The providers, physicians, and teams must be set up properly and accurately for the correct individuals to receive the notification.

**Notifications, cont’d**

**Flag Orderable Item(s) to Send Notifications [ORB3 FLAG ORDERABLE ITEMS]**

This option has two sub-options to flag specific orderable items to send notifications when they are ordered, resulted, or expiring.  
**Archive(delete) after \<x\> Days [ORB3 ARCHIVE PERIOD]**  
Enter the number of days to archive this notification before deletion in the Alert Tracking file. If not indicated, the default period of 30 days is used. The maximum number of days is 100,000 or about 220 years. This value is passed to the Kernel Alert Utility where the actual archiving and deletion of alerts/notifications occurs.  
**Forward Unprocessed Notification to Supervisor [ORB3 FORWARD SUPERVISOR]**  
This option lets you set the number of days to hold a notification before forwarding it to the recipient’s supervisor. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification will not be forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of 14 for this option, it will be forwarded to the supervisor of each recipient who hasn’t processed the notification after 14 days. Determination of recipients who have not processed the notification and who their supervisors are is made by the Kernel Alert Utility. Kernel identifies the supervisor as the service chief of the user’s service. The notification will not be forwarded to supervisors of recipients who have processed the alert within 14 days. If the value of this option is zero or non-existent, the alert/notification will never be forwarded. Forwarding of unprocessed alerts is triggered by the option XQALERT DELETE OLD. This option is a Kernel option that should be tasked to run periodically. In addition to forwarding alerts, it cleans up old alerts greater than 14 days old.  
**Forward Unprocessed Notification to Surrogates [ORB3 FORWARD SURROGATES]**  
This option lets you set the number of days before a notification is forwarded to a recipient's Mailman surrogates. The maximum is 30 days. If not indicated or zero, the notification will not be forwarded. For example, if a notification has a value of 14 for this option, it will be forwarded to the Mailman surrogates of each recipient who hasn't processed the notification after 14 days.

The Kernel Alert Utility determines recipients who have not processed the notification and their Mailman surrogates. If the value of this option is zero or non-existent, the alert/notification will never be forwarded. Forwarding of unprocessed alerts is triggered by the option XQALERT DELETE OLD, a Kernel option that should be tasked to run periodically. In addition to forwarding alerts, it cleans up old alerts greater than 14 days old.

Forwarded by: CPRSPROVIDER,FOUR Generated: 07/02/97 14:40:32  
ALERT NOT PROCESSED BY CPRSPROVIDER,FOUR  
For this notification to work, a link must exist between the term DNR used by the CPRS expert system and each site’s local term used to denote DNR. After CPRS installation, each site must run the option OCX NATIONAL TERM EDIT (on the CPRS Configuration Menu (IRM). This option links terms used in the expert system to local terms. Some terms like DNR and NPO diet must be mapped to one or more entries in the orderable item file. Other terms like Serum Creatinine must be mapped to the lab test file.

**Set Delays for Unverified Orders [ORB3 UNVERIFIED ORDERS MENU]**  
This menu provides access to options that set up parameters for delaying unverified orders alert triggers.  
***

**Set Delay for All Unverified Orders [ORB3 UNVERIFIED ORDER]**  
This option lets you enter the number of hours delay to wait after an order is placed before triggering an Unverified Order notification/alert. The maximum number of hours is 10,000.  
***

**Set Delay for Unverified Medication Orders [ORB3 UNVERIFIED MED ORDER]**  
This option lets you enter the number of hours delay to wait after a medication order is placed before triggering an Unverified Medication Order notification/alert. The maximum number of hours is 10,000.  
***

**Set Notification Display Sort Method (GUI) [ORB3 SORT METHOD]**  
This option lets you determine the order in which items of a notification are displayed in the GUI. The items include: by Patient, by Type (Notification name), and by Urgency. Within these sort methods notifications are presented in reverse chronological order.

**Send Flagged Orders Bulletin [ORB3 FLAGGED ORDERS BULLETIN]**  
This option lets you indicate whether to send a bulletin when an order is flagged for clarification. “Yes” indicates a MailMan bulletin will be sent to the order’s Current Provider (usually the Ordering Provider). This option has no effect on the Flagged Orders notification which is also triggered when an order is flagged for clarification.

**Notifications, cont’d**

**Determine Recipients for a Notification [ORB3 DETERMINE RECIPIENTS]**  
This option lets you create a simulated notification recipient list, without sending the alert. You are prompted for information about recipients: patient, and notification, with the option to enter an order number and/or a recipient. Output can be directed to a device. This option is intended to serve as a tool to help determine why a user did or did not receive a particular notification. Please note: if team lists, patient-provider relationships (e.g. Attending and Primary), and/or parameter values have changed between the moment when the original notification was triggered and when this option is triggered, the outcome of the recipient list may be different.  
**Display Patient Alerts and Alert recipients [ORB3 ALERT RECIPIENTS]**  
This option produces a list of all OE/RR alerts for a specified patient for the dates you enter. You can also get a detailed listing on specific alerts attached to the patient record. The detailed report shows each recipient and gives dates and times of key actions concerning the alert (such as 1st displayed, processed, deleted, etc.)

In the following example, the alerts are listed for a specific patient and details are listed on one of the alerts. The order number, if it exists, (and sometimes other information) is included in brackets after the alert name. This information is here for troubleshooting purposes.

### 7. Order Checking  
**Order checking, a component of order entry, is based on a system of rules, which review orders to see if they meet defined criteria. If they meet the criteria, an electronic message is sent to the ordering provider before the order is completed (such as duplicate order, drug-lab interaction, etc.). The provider can then choose to cancel the order or override the order check and place the order.**  
**☞ NOTE:** All order checks are exported disabled at the system level. When IRMS turns them on at the system level, they are then turned on for everyone. IRMS, Clinical Coordinators, individuals, or services can then disable individual order checks if they choose to.

**IMPORTANT:** If your site doesn’t want individuals to be able to disable order checks, consider not assigning users the option *Enable/Disable Order Checks.*  
**Relationship of Order Checking to Notifications**

Order Checks are similar to Notifications in that both review existing data and current events to produce a relevant message that is presented to patient care-givers. Also, both systems use the CPRS expert system (OCX namespace), to define logical expressions for this evaluation and message creation. In addition to the expert system, both systems have some hard-coded algorithms. For example, the critical drug interaction order check is made via an entry point in the pharmacy package whereas renal functions for patients over 65 is defined as a rule in the CPRS expert system.

The main difference between the two systems is their focus. Order Checks are a real-time process that occurs during the ordering session and are driven by responses entered by the ordering provider. Order Check messages are displayed interactively in the ordering session. In contrast, Notifications occur behinds the scenes, monitoring data as it flows through DHCP and when certain trigger events occur.

**Order Checking, cont’d**

**How does Order Checking work?**

Order Checking performs checks while ordering is taking place.

Before orders go to services such as Lab and Pharmacy, they are sent to Order Checking where the ordered item is evaluated by an expert system rule against data from patient files. If one or more of the designated rules of logic for that type of order is met, order check messages are presented to the clinician placing the order.

**Note:** The DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION order check has been renamed CRITICAL DRUG INTERACTION. All parameter values associated with DRUG-DRUG are now associated with CRITICAL DRUG INTERACTION. A new order check, SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTION, has been added to the Order Check File ([\#100.8]. The exported, package-level parameter values for this new order check are ORK PROCESSING FLAG = "Enabled" and ORK CLINICAL DANGER LEVEL = "Moderate". The new order check lets sites designate significant drug interaction with a lower clinical danger level.

**☞ REMEMBER:** All of these order checks are exported disabled at the system level. When IRMS turns them on at the system level, they are then turned on for everyone. IRMS, Clinical Coordinators, individuals, or services can then disable individual order checks if they choose to.

### Order Checking Management Menu

**Several parameters must be set before certain order checks can work properly. Options in the Order Checking Management Options Menu allow you to set these parameters.**

**Enable/Disable an Order Check**

Use this option to turn specific order checks on or off for a user or location. The option works by entering a processing flag for an entity and order check. The entity can be a user, location, service, division, or system.

**Processing flags**

**E** (Enabled): Order check is enabled for the entity unless an entity of higher precedence has order check disabled (e.g. if Enabled at System level and Disabled at User level, order check is not processed).

**D** (Disabled): Order check is disabled for the entity unless an entity of higher precedence has the order check Enabled (e.g. if Disabled at System level and Enabled at User level, order check is processed).

The delivery of order checks is determined from values set for Users,  
Inpatient Locations, Service/Sections, Hospital Divisions, Computer System and  
OERR. Possible values include 'Enabled' and 'Disabled'. These values indicate  
a User's, Location's, Service/Section's, Division's, System's and OERR's  
desire for the order check to be 'Enabled' (displayed under most  
circumstances) or 'Disabled' (normally not displayed.)  
***

All values, except the OERR (Order Entry) value, can be set by IRM  
or Clinical Coordinators. Individual users can set their 'Enabled/Disabled'  
values for each specific order check via the 'Enable/Disable My Order Checks'  
option under the Personal Preferences and Order Check Management for Users.  
'ON' indicates the user will receive the order check under normal conditions.  
'OFF' indicates the user normally will not receive the order check.  
Order check recipient determination can also be influenced by patient  
location (inpatients only.) This list does not consider patient location  
when calculating the ON/OFF value for an order check because a patient is  
not known when the option is selected.

**Clinician, Nurse, or Ward Clerk Menus**

These menus all contain the same options, but available actions are defined by keys and the assignment of a primary add order menu. These are also the same options available with OE/RR 2.5, but they function somewhat differently in CPRS.

### b. Order Menu Management

This menu is exported with Patch 49, and is also on the CPRS Configuration Menu (Clin Coord), on the CPRS Manager Menu.

If your site used OE/RR 2.5, most of your menus, quick orders, and generic orders are converted to CPRS when it’s installed. Order Menu Management options can help you convert protocols that weren't automatically converted, edit or create quick orders and generic orders, create order sets, and assign primary order menus.

If your site hasn't used OE/RR 2.5, you can use options on the Order Menu Management menu (distributed with the pre-installation patch, OR\*2.5\*49, or on the CPRS Configuration Menu when CPRS is installed) to begin creating menus, quick orders, and parameters.

**If your site hasn't used OE/RR 2.5, you must create and assign primary order menus for all of your users.**

| **Option Name**       | **Menu Text**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Orderable Items**

Orderable items correspond to those services or products that may be requested and provided by the patient care services. They can be things such as a lab test, an imaging procedure, or a medication. The ORDERABLE ITEM file (\#101.43) contains the orderable items for each service. CPRS uses orderable items to identify the specific thing that has been ordered. Each package that interfaces with CPRS provides a mechanism to update or add to the orderable items belonging to the package.

### Generic Orders

Nursing and Activity orders, often referred to as *generic orders*, have no defined specifications for the required prompts or the format of the order text. The option *Enter/edit* *orderable items* [ORCM ORDERABLES] lets you add new entries of the nursing care or activity types.

Generic orders are comprised of:

1\. *Orderable Item*

Defines the exact service or product being requested. This is easy to define for ancillary service orders in the hospital such as radiology or pharmacy, but for generic orders, the Clinical Coordinator or IRMS defines and creates the orderable items.

2\. *Prompts*

Prompts ask information about the order being placed.

3\. *Start and stop dates*

To create a generic order, we recommend that you first write the text of the order, as you would like it to read. Then you can construct a generic order that will put the text together to read as you have written it.

### Naming Conventions

We recommend that you select naming conventions for the orderable items, prompts, and generic orders that you create using the Order Menu Management options.

Advantages:

-   Allows similar types of order dialogs to be grouped together by name so that the type is apparent

-   Allows those managing the order dialogs to find a specific order dialog more quickly because the names are organized by type

    All applications interfacing with CPRS use consistent naming conventions to easily identify those order dialogs that belong with that application.

    Suggested naming conventions:

    ORZ GTX prompt type

    ORZ dialog type (generic orders)

    ORZ ADD MENU add order menus

#### Enter/Edit Orderable Items

This option lets you enter new generic orderable items to be placed on CPRS Add Orders menus, or to edit existing generic orderable items (e.g., change their names to ones more meaningful to your users).

#### Enter/edit Prompts

Prompts are the second component of the order dialog that makes up a generic order dialog. This type of order dialog corresponds to the *term type* protocol in OE/RR 2.5. However, rather than using VA FileMan to create the prompt, you can now use this option.

This option lets you add or edit prompts of the following types:

D date/time

R relative date/time

F free text

N numeric

S set of codes

P pointer to a file

Y yes/no

W word processing

#### Enter/edit Generic Orders

Generic order dialogs in CPRS serve the same function as generic text orders in OE/RR v 2.5. They define a patient’s activities or document instructions to nursing or ward staff for the care of the patient. Text order protocols used in OE/RR are converted to the ORDER DIALOG (\#101.41) file and can now be used in CPRS.

The process for creating new generic order dialogs in CPRS is quite different from the process used in the previous version. All generic order dialogs are created or modified using this option. When you create a new generic order dialog, you will be given the choice of copying an existing order dialog. A good guideline for creating most new generic order dialogs would be to copy the existing order dialog OR GXMISC GENERAL. This order dialog has the four basic prompts that make up a generic order: an orderable item, at least one comment-type prompt, a start date, and a stop date.

The following sequence shows:

-   The process of creating a new generic order dialog that will assign the patient to a specific counseling group, ask the approximate date of the traumatic event, ask which days the group will meet, and ask whether the patient’s family should participate.

-   The prompts as they would be asked during an ordering session

-   The help text for each prompt that the user is required to answer

-   The appearance of the order once it becomes part of the patient record.

**General Information**

1.  The use of an orderable item in each generic order is advised, as it will allow ordering statistics to be gathered. The orderable item is stored in the ORDER (\#100) file and cross referenced to facilitate gathering of such statistics

1.  Spaces are not required at the beginning or end of the leading or trailing text, the dialog driver will insert them.

1.  Generic orders may use a start date and stop date. There are existing prompts that are a start date (OR GTX START DATE ), stop date (OR GTX STOP DATE), start date/time (OR GTX START DATE/TIME) and stop date/time (OR GTX STOP DATE/TIME). We recommend that you use the existing prompts, as they already contain validation code to ensure proper date and/or time input. Defaults may also be entered for the start date or stop date on each generic order dialog.

1.  **NOTE**: No changes are saved until PLACE is selected.

#### Enter/Edit Quick Orders

**Quick orders in CPRS have the same functionality as they did in OE/RR V. 2.5⎯they speed up the ordering process by predefining many of the answers that a user would normally have to type in while placing orders.**  
The process for creating quick orders has been standardized with this option. In OE/RR v 2.5, quick orders for Radiology, Inpatient Medications, Vitals, and Consults were created using an option in those packages. Lab and Dietetics quick orders required programmer level access. With CPRS, quick orders for all packages are created and edited using this option; no special VA FileManager access is required.

The dialog presented while creating quick orders varies, depending on the package associated with the quick order. The dialog is very similar to what is seen while actually placing an order for that package. In addition, you may indicate for each quick order if the ordering person will be allowed/should be required to review and verify the order before accepting.

A major advantage in CPRS is that quick orders can be edited. As was the recommendation in OE/RR v 2.5, the creation of quick orders for any package should be done in coordination with the application coordinator for that service. It is also a good practice to create quick orders based on real need instead of anticipated need. Once created, the quick orders can be placed on any appropriate order menu.

##### Namespacing

Quick Orders should follow a consistent naming convention. Starting each quick order name with a consistent set of letters will make the quick orders easy to identify, easy to organize, and prevent creation of duplicates.

*Recommended Guidelines for naming quick orders:*

1.  Append a Z to the end of the exported namespace for each package

2.  Make the name of the quick order as descriptive as possible. The name of the quick order should contain the name of the orderable item and should include reference to as many of the defined prompts as possible (e.g., RAZ CHEST 2 VIEWS STAT PORTABLE).

3.  Quick Order names should be unique within the first 30 characters.

Order sets are groups of quick orders that are commonly ordered together for certain situations, such as pre-admission, pre-operative, etc. The sets can be created through this option by selecting quick orders from all services. Then when you enter the order screens for CPRS, you can pick an order set by the name you gave it in this option.**  
***

** NOTE:** Order Sets in CPRS are slightly different than they were in OE/RR v 2.5. In version 2.5, order sets could be of the protocol menu type where ordering items could be grouped and the user would choose which items to order from that menu. Order sets could also be extended action type protocols which ordered all of the items upon choice of the order set. CPRS considers all order sets to be extended action types and doesn’t prompt the user for the items contained within.

#### Enter/Edit Order Menus

Use this option to edit the items on an existing order menu or to create new order menus. Order menus you create here will be available to your users in both the List Manager and GUI interfaces when you assign them as primary order menus.

Order Menus in CPRS are just one type of Order dialog.

All add order menus in CPRS are order menus. Add order menus in CPRS allow great customization. In addition to adding, deleting, and editing items, you now have the ability to insert headers or titles to further organize the ordering items. You may add or delete rows as well and you can define the exact position of a specific item, as opposed to items shifting when an item is inserted.

To make order menus as friendly to users as possible, you should try to keep the length of the menu to 17 rows. When the menu is displayed to users, they will only be able to see the first 17 rows of a menu on the first page. Longer menus force users to scroll to the next screen to see all of the available items. This can lead to frustration and mistakes by new users because order items are “hidden” from view.

** NOTE:** In OE/RR v 2.5, order sets could be created by using the protocol menu type, which allowed the selection of items to be ordered. In CPRS, these order sets are now order menus and allow the same customization as described above.

** NOTE:** We recommend that you add “Z” or your local namespace to new items that you create. This isn’t required, but it helps for distinguishing local changes from exported items.

**1.** Select Enter/edit order menus from the CPRS Implementation Menu.

#### Convert Protocols

This option lets you convert individual protocols used in OE/RR 2.5 to CPRS orderable items.

**☞ NOTE:** Most protocols currently on OE/RR 2.5 menus at a site are automatically converted to CPRS menus. However, many quick orders created by sites have entry and exit actions containing M code, which the conversion utility can’t convert. Before converting these, you need to use the *Enter/Edit Orderable Items* to delete the entry and exit actions.

1.  Select Convert Protocols from the Order Menu Management menu on the CPRS Implementation menu.

### 9. Patient and Team Lists

If your site has patient and team lists set up through OE/RR 2.5, these will be automatically converted during the installation process. Review these after the installation, and modify, if necessary.

##### Creating Patient or Team Lists

Clinicians can create patient lists by ward, clinic, or by patient to use for displaying results or creating reports. They can build lists, delete lists, merge lists, add or delete patients from lists, or inquire to a file of patient lists.

Clinical Coordinators can help to set up team lists for groups of clinicians and related hospital personnel. Clinicians can create patient lists by ward, clinic, or by patient to use for displaying results or creating reports. They can build lists, delete lists, merge lists, add or delete patients from lists, or inquire to a file of patient lists.

If a user has a list defined and loaded (as determined in the Personal Preferences options), the list will be available every time the user selects the CPRS Clinician, Nurse, or Ward Clerk Menu. The user will then select a patient from the list. This list can also be used for printing reports.

The team lists also help determine who receives notifications for patients defined on the lists.

These providers are the list's users. You may now create a new team list  
or add autolinks, users and/or patients to an existing team list. Autolinks  
automatically add or remove patients with ADT movements. Users on the list  
may receive notifications regarding patients on the same list. Please prefix  
your list name with 'TEAM' or 'SERVICE' (e.g. TEAM7B, SERVICECARDIOLOGY.)

### 10. Print Formats

The CPRS *Print Formats* option allows a lot of flexibility in customizing reports for CPRS. Each site must select the print formats it will use for printing labels, requisitions, order copies, and chart copies. The hospital’s Medical Records Committee needs to approve the print formats chosen for its site. Be sure to determine how many printers you’ll need for each ward, and where they’ll be located.

We distribute pre-defined print formats that point to pre-defined print fields. You may copy these to a number space between 1 and 999 and modify these for your use. If the pre-defined print fields don’t satisfy your print requirements, then create a new field in the CPRS PRINT FIELDS file in the number space between 1 and 999. If you are transferring an entry in the PRINT FIELDS file (\#100.22) to the 1-999 range for local use, answer “NO” to the prompt “Do you want the pointers updated?”; otherwise, existing print formats that depend on old definitions will be altered.

**Definitions**

| Work Copy      | A working copy of order(s) that will be kept                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 1. Order Check Expert System  
**Order Checking and Notifications both rely on a subset of CPRS called the Order Check Expert System. This includes a library of rules, elements, and a data dictionary, as well as facilities to maintain these data sets. Eventually the Expert System may be used for clinicians and others to create rules of their own by combining entities, elements, and rules.**  
***

**How it works:**  
**The Order Check Expert System is based on a set of Rules or Medical Logic Modules (MLM). The term Medical Logic Module, synonymous with rule or frame, is derived from the Arden Syntax, a standard for sharing MLMs and knowledge bases among decision support developers. The Order Check Expert System will support the Arden Syntax and will be able to share knowledge bases with other nonprofit entities.**  
***

**At this point, the Expert System is mostly used as a compiler and as a tool for monitoring and debugging Order Checking and Notifications. The options on the Order Check Expert System Main Menu can be used to perform these functions.**  
***

**Compiler**  
The compiler generates routines. The OCX post-install routine runs the compiler to generate an initial set of Order Checking routines. The post-install runs the compiler with default compiler options. One of the options is called Execution Trace. The default for this option is NO. When this option is set to YES, the compiler adds write statements to the compiled code that displays various aspects of the runtime environment. It displays information about the runtime datastream as well as the sequence of line labels as the compiled routine set executes. When this option is set to NO it does not add these additional statements. Adding this extra code makes the compiled routines bigger, but, since the compiler has a routine size limit (4k) imposed on it, it tends to make more routines instead. Thus, you may wind up with more routines.

### 2. ORMTIME and Job Tasking

ORMTIME is a background processor that is used in conjunction with the ORTASK routines to manage background jobs for order processing. They are intended for IRMS only.

ORMTIME is automatically scheduled once the Orders conversion is done. REQUEUE\^ORMTIME is called from CLEANUP\^OR3CONV1, which occurs when the conversion completes.

The following notifications/alerts are triggered via ORMTIME. If ORMTIME

is not running/queued, they will not be sent.

DNR Expiring

Medications Expiring

NPO Diet \> 72 Hours

Unverified Medication Order

### ORMTIME Main Menu [ORMTIME MAIN]

This menu contains options that are used for managing ORMTIME.

**NOTE**: As of 12/98, these options are not exported.

| **Option**                      | **Name**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Reschedule Background Processor | ORMTIME REQUEUE BACKGROUND JOB | Use this opton to Queue or Requeue ORMTIME. It is safe to run this option if ORMTIME is already queued. There is a check in the queueing code to see if the job is already queued and will not queue another if it finds one already there.                                  |
| Get Background Job Status       | ORMTIME BACKGROUND JOB STATUS  | This option gives a status report of when ORMTIME last ran and also indicates when it is next scheduled to run. It also indicates when each of the seven ORMTIME failsafe jobs are supposed to run.                                                                          |
| Kill all ORMTIME Taskman Tasks  | ORMTIME KILL ALL TASKS         | This option is used to stop ORMTIME and all of its failsafe jobs. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS OPTION. There are several Expert System purges that depend on ORMTIME and if ORMTIME is not running then the Expert System will eventually fill up the Volume Set it resides in. |

### 3. CPRS Clean-up Utilities  
**Lab-OE/RR Inconsistency Checker**

Check Lab orders from file 100 to 69 [ORE LAB ORDERS CHECK 100=\>69]

This option does a number of consistency checks between OE/RR’s Order file (100) and Lab’s Order file (69). It was originally developed as a programmer’s utility to check the integrity of data between the two applications. Later, code was added to correct the inconsistencies. It has proved useful to sites in troubleshooting and correcting problems. Some of the problems, such as incorrect status updates, have been occurring since the previous version of OE/RR. Other problems happen as a result of system crashes or errors during the ordering process.

This option gathers information without making any changes to the database. It takes a long time to run⎯several hours to several days⎯depending on the size of the global, so it would be best to run this at night or on the weekend.

The program starts by looping through all the entries in the Orders file (100). It checks to make sure that required global nodes are present. If the nodes are unrecognized or beyond repair, they are simple removed, so that programs that expect this data to exist do not crash. Checks for missing or invalid pointers are made and corrected. The status of the order in the Orders file (100) is compared to the status in the Lab files and corrected if necessary. Incorrect OE/RR statuses have been a problem in the past. This option is what has been used to make things consistent.

The answers you give to several questions affect the way this option affects the database. Here are explanations of these questions:

1\. *Any problems will be displayed. Continue?*

This question allows the user to get out of the option before doing anything, after reviewing the help text.

2\. *Check for CPRS orders that no longer exist in the Lab Order file?*

Answering YES to this question causes the links between OE/RR and Lab to be checked. If the link is gone, and the order has not gone to completion or has been cancelled, then the order’s status is changed to cancelled. Answering NO leaves the status alone.

3\. *Do you want to remove old PENDING, ACTIVE and UNRELEASED orders?*

Answering YES to this question affects orders with a status of pending, active, and unreleased, that also have a start date in the past. The user gets to pick how far back to start looking for those start dates. Old Unreleased orders are removed from the system. Old pending orders are changed to a Lapsed status, which will remove them from the current orders context. Active orders that no longer have corresponding entries in the lab files are changed to a status of Lapsed.

4\. *OK, which ORIFN do you want to start with: 0//*

This question allows you to select a starting point in the Orders file (100) to begin checking. ORIFN is the internal entry number in file 100 to start with [ \^OR(100,ORIFN) ]. This is useful if you only want to check entries recently added to the file. For example, you might suspect a recent patch might have affected the way a status is updated in OE/RR files. You could find a starting point in file 100 about the same time the patch was installed and start checking orders from that point. Looking at the 3rd ‘\^’ piece of the global \^OR(100,0) will give you the last entry in file 100.

5\. *Do you want me to correct the inconsistencies now?*

Answering YES to this question will correct any problems that can be corrected. Answering NO will not correct the problem, but it will display a message when a problem is found.

At the end of the report, any problems found will be totaled and displayed.

If you have never run this option, it should be done at your earliest convenience. After that, it can be run as often as once a month or as little as once a year, unless otherwise instructed. If your site is journaling the \^OR global and you have not run this option for a very long time, special precautions may need to be taken. Most of the corrections are status updates. A status update would make approximately three entries in a journal file. To get an idea of the total impact on the journal, run this option once without correcting the inconsistencies, take the total number of inconsistencies, and multiply by three. This should give you a general idea of how many sets and kills will be added to the journal; then you can adjust the journal space accordingly.

**Creating or adding to the Write Orders list**

The parameters that control the "Write Orders" list are edited via the General Parameter Tools menu (XPAR MENU TOOLS).

**Using General Parameter Tools on the CPRS Configuration menu (IRM)**

1\. Use the *List Values for a Selected Parameter* option to see how the parameter for the write orders list is exported (the package level of the parameter ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST).

2\. Use *Edit Parameter Values*, select ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST.

3\. Select "System" to enter the dialogs and menus that you want to appear in the list at your site.

**Using Order Menu Management - Enter/edit order menus on the CPRS configuration menu (Clin Coord).**

1\. Create a new menu. Remember, this menu will be what shows up in the list box on the left side of the orders tab, so it should be a single column. You can put what you want in this list. The idea was that it would contain the most common ordering menus and dialogs to which a user needs access.

2\. After creating the menu, use *Edit Parameter Values* and select ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST as the parameter.

3\. Select "System" and enter the menu you just created as the value. You can override by exception what you set for the system level by setting the parameter for a particular division or user. The ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter takes precedence over the ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter, if both are present.

You can find what was on the "Write Orders" list to start with by using the parameter tools menu (XPAR MENU TOOLS), selecting List Values for a selected parameter, and entering ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST as the parameter. The exported list will be preceded by PKG. If the list has been modified at your site, each item will be preceded by SYS. If a list has been set up for a specific user, it will be preceded by USR.

The "Write Orders" list, as exported, contains the following dialogs:

Sequence Value Display Name  
30 FHW1 Diet  
52 PSJ OR PAT OE Meds, Inpatient  
55 PSO OERR Meds, Outpatient  
58 PSJI OR PAT FLUID OE IV Fluids

70 RA OERR EXAM Radiology  
80 GMRCOR CONSULT Consult  
85 GMRCOR REQUEST Procedure  
90 GMRVOR Vitals  
99 OR GXTEXT WORD PROCESSING ORDER Text Only Order  
The sequence is just an arbitrary number to indicate the order that the dialog should be in the list.

### List Manager Terminal Setup

Check the List Manager Attributes file. You may need to update the Terminal Type file for the VT100's. If the “Insert Line” field is empty, this will cause List Manager to revert back to scroll mode.

List Manager uses 11 video attributes, which are in the Terminal Type file (\#3.2). These are listed (along with recommended values) in the Site Preparation section of the *List Manager Developer’s Guide*.

**E. CPRS Hardware & Software Requirements and Recommendations**

The following information contains recommendations for workstations, servers, and cabling plants. These recommendations are for requirements beyond the basic upgrading of the facility's main computer cluster to the newer DEC Alpha systems to provide the additional capacity needed to run CPRS and related packages (e.g. TIU, PCMM, PDM),  
VHA facilities are encouraged to budget and purchase PC workstations as replacements for dumb terminals. The VHA LAN and Workstation Requirements task force report should be used too as a guide.  
**Note:** The List Manager interface, non-GUI version, of CPRS does not require a PC workstation.  
**Workstation Hardware**  
CPRS does not have specific workstation requirements beyond the VA Standard Desktop Configurations.  
**Local Area Networks**  
**Server hardware (non VISTA servers)**  
For simplicity of support, facilities should consider purchasing the same type of hardware used for the *VISTA* servers. These systems would both run the recommended server NOS (network operating system) of Microsoft Windows NT. General features to be considered include:  
-   Single processor system with capacity to expand to multi-processor  
-   RAID magnetic disk drive configurations for critical applications  
-   Backup device  
-   Fast disk controller (SCSI-2)  
-   Uninterruptable power supply (UPS) with shutdown software  
-   Modems for RAS and system access by support personnel  
**Server software**  
-   Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x or 4.x. Microsoft Windows NT has been selected as the recommended server NOS (network operating system) for non- *VISTA* applications within VHA  
-   Electronic mail: Microsoft Exchange Enterprise Version.  
-   *VISTA* Request Broker on *VISTA* servers  
-   CD ROM resources: Network versions of medical reference sources such as Physicians Data Reference  
-   Optional workstation management software, e.g. SMS  
**LAN naming conventions**  
LAN naming conventions are important as we maximize the benefit from our installed systems. The best trade-offs need to be made to ensure that the results are user friendly, compatible with evolving computer networking technology, and compatible with other VA organizations. Conventions are needed for objects such as user names, domains, servers, shared directories, post offices, printers, printer queues, groups, workstation computer names, login scripts, and shared resource names (FAX, modem pools, CD ROM towers). It is possible that these conventions will need to change over time. The VHA NT naming conventions documents can be found on the internal VA Intranet server under medical automation, at link *h ttp://152.128.2. 7/mediauto/domain7. doc.*  
**LAN architecture**  
The VHA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has developed the VHA LAN Architecture for use as guidance in the implementation of a scaleable, open local area network (LAN) architecture at VHA facilities.

The key assumption underlying the design of the recommended architecture is reflected in the 1992 VHA report, DHCP Facility Data Communications Cabling Recommendations and Implementation Strategies. The network backbone is a fiber optic implementation and the horizontal wiring is realized using three four-pair unshielded twisted pair (UTP) category 5 cables to the workspace. Three corresponding architectures were recommended in support of the three business cases.  
***

The crux of the recommended VAMC architecture is LAN switching realized with Ethernet, FDDI, and ultimately, ATM technologies. The augmented recommended architecture includes an alternative architecture for VA facilities with conservative demands and limited economic resources.  
**Facility wiring/cabling**  
Facility wiring and cabling recommendations are outlined in the 1992 VHA report DHCP Facility Data Communications Cabling Recommendations and Implementation Strategies released to the field in January 1992.  
***

Facility-wide connectivity would include a multi-mode fiber optic backbone to all wiring locations, and category 5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) wiring to all work/user locations. Such a cabling scheme is anticipated to support any future recommendation for a LAN architecture. The VII Telecommunications Infrastructure Project (TIP) is currently underway aimed at helping sites upgrade to the appropriate cabling and LAN architecture.

**Files**

Inpatient Meds uses the following fields from the Pharmacy System file

(\^PS(59.7)):

NON-FORMULARY MESSAGE: This is a message that will be shown to non-pharmacists when they order patient drugs that are not currently stocked by the pharmacy. This is typically a warning and/or a procedure the non-pharmacist must follow before pharmacy will dispense the non-formulary drug.

ALLOW THE CHANGE OF ORDER TYPES ON ORDERS FROM OERR: This field is a site parameter that will allow the pharmacist to change the type of order from what is received from CPRS. If this field is set to yes, it will be possible to change the order type on orders where the Orderable Item has data in the CORRESPONDING IV ITEM field for unit dose orders or data in the CORRESPONDING UD ITEM for IV orders.

IV IDENTIFIER: This is a free-text field that can be up to 30 characters. If the Orderable Item is marked for IV usage, this text will display next to the Orderable Item to distinguish a Unit dose from an IV drug.

These fields can be accessed through the *Systems Parameters Edit* [PSJ SYS EDIT] option.

## A. Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART)  
Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) doesn’t require any set-up for CPRS.

Patch GMRA\*4\*4 contains interface routines and fixes to the CPRS/ART interface. It needs to be installed before CPRS.

## B. Patient Movement

The Bed Control (Admission, Discharge, and Transfer) package doesn’t require any special set-up or have any special options for setting parameters for CPRS. However, Bed Control options can be used by other packages to tie their various events to the MAS events. These package events are processed after the DGPM MOVEMENT EVENTS option has been completed.

-   **Review and assign sequence numbers to protocols in the DGPM Movement Events field of the Protocol file.**

    All protocols in this ITEM field of the PROTOCOL file must be sequenced before the OR protocols.

    Most of the necessary movement event protocols are automatically assigned during the CPRS installation. Make sure the following CPRS protocols are in the DGPM Movement Events field, in a sequence similar to the following:

    ITEM: DGOERR NOTE SEQUENCE: 13 (*this should have the    lowest sequence \#)*

    ITEM: FHWMAS SEQUENCE: 14

    ITEM: LR70 MOVEMENT EVENT SEQUENCE: 15

    ITEM: OCX ORDER CHECK PATIENT MOVE SEQUENCE: 16

    ITEM: PSJ OR PAT ADT SEQUENCE: 19

    ITEM: ORU AUTOLIST SEQUENCE: 21

    ITEM: ORU REVIEW DELAYED ORDERS SEQUENCE: 22

    ITEM: ORU PATIENT MOVMT SEQUENCE: 100

    ITEM: OR GUA EVENT PROCESSOR NOTASK SEQUENCE: 999 (*this should have the    highest sequence \#)*

    **Example: Entering a protocol sequence \# for DGPM MOVEMENT EVENTS**

    Select OPTION: **ENTER** OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: OPTION// **101** PROTOCOL (3374 entries)  
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// **ITEM**  
EDIT WHICH ITEM SUB-FIELD: ALL// **\<Enter\>**

MNEMONIC: **\<Enter\>**  
SEQUENCE: 69// **13**  
MODIFYING ACTION:**\^**  
Select ITEM: **\<Enter\>**  
**DGPM Movement Events**

At the completion of a patient movement, the following events take place through this option:

1.  The PTF record is updated when a patient is admitted, discharged, or transferred.

2.  The appointment status for a patient is updated to “inpatient” for admissions and “outpatient” for discharges. Admissions to the domiciliary have an “outpatient” appointment status.

3.  When a patient is admitted, dietetics creates a dietetic patient file entry and creates an admission diet order. When a patient is discharged, all active diet orders are discontinued. If a patient is absent or on pass, the diet orders are suspended.

4.  Inpatient pharmacy cancels all active orders when a patient is admitted, discharged, or on unauthorized absence. A patient can’t be given Unit Dose meds unless s/he is admitted to a ward. The patient can receive IV meds, however. When a patient is transferred, an inpatient system parameter is used to determine whether or not the orders should be cancelled. When a patient goes on authorized absence, the inpatient system parameter is used to determine whether the orders should be cancelled, placed on hold, or no action taken. When a patient returns from authorized absence, any orders placed on hold will no longer be on hold.

5.  Orders for a patient may be reviewed for further action by the user.

6.  MAS notifications may be displayed to users defined in a CPRS list for that patient. These notifications are displayed for admissions, deaths, and discharges.

## C. Consult/Request Tracking

**See the Consult/Request Tracking V. 3.0 Technical Manual for complete details on implementing and maintaining the package.**

**See the TIU section in this manual for instructions on setting up the TIU/Consults/CPRS interface.**

**Patch GMRC\*2.5\*17**

All sites running v2.5 of Consult/Request Tracking must install this patch prior to installing CPRS v1.0. This patch can be loaded anytime prior to the CPRS v1.0 installation at your site but it is recommended that you load it just prior to installing CPRS v1.0. If you create a new GMRCR protocol after installing this patch you must reinstall the patch. Installing the patch multiple times does not cause any problems. The CPRS v1.0 installation includes Consult/Request Tracking v3.0.

**NOTE**: Since this patch was created after the CPRS v1.0 build, the environment checks for CPRS v1.0 and Consult/Request Tracking v3.0 do not check to see that this patch has been installed prior to the CPRS v1.0 install.

**Service and Specialty Hierarchy**

If your site has set up a Service and Specialty hierarchy through version 2.5, this is converted with the installation of CPRS.

The Request Services file (\#123.5) is distributed with a small selection of services. The hierarchical relationships are not in place upon distribution.

The small selection of services distributed with the package should not be deleted from the Request Services file (\#123.5) under any circumstances. You may delete locally defined services and their associated hierarchies until the services are selected for ordering consults. Once the ordering process has begun **DO NOT DELETE** a service entry. Instead, disable the service using the SERVICE USAGE field in file 123.5. Disabled services are not selectable for ordering or tracking.  
The Service/Specialty hierarchy you define can be as complex as needed to meet service requirements at your site. To get started you will probably want to specify a small subset of services/specialties and add to them over a period of time. ALL SERVICES needs to be the top entry in the hierarchy.

In order to build the service hierarchy, you will need to know how the service entry in the Request Services file (\#123.5) will be used. Some services will be used as a GROUPER ONLY and other services may be used for TRACKING ONLY. The SERVICE USAGE field is provided for you to differentiate the services in the hierarchy.

To see your site’s hierarchy, use the *Consults Service Tracking* [GMRC SERVICE TRACKING] option and enter ?? at the "Select Service/Specialty:"

**For the Consults tab of CPRS to function properly, any new service added to the hierarchy must be made a sub-service of ALL SERVICES!!**  
If the service is not directly placed under the ALL SERVICES heading, it must be a sub-service of a service that IS under ALL SERVICES. If a service is not in the hierarchy under the ALL SERVICES heading, users will not be able to view or respond to the consult from the consults tab in CPRS after it has been sent.

### Sample Hierarchy

ALL SERVICES  
REHAB MEDICINE (GROUPER)  
PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION  
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (TRACKER)  
KENESIOTHERAPY (TRACKER)  
PHYSICAL THERAPY (TRACKER)  
MEDICINE (GROUPER)  
CARDIOLOGY  
ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY  
GI INFECTIOUS DISEASE  
#### 

Each hospital service or primary care team should work with the IRMS staff and its Clinical Coordinator to define its service and specialty hierarchy, who the users will be, and the types of consults that are orderable from its specialties. Service users may range from clerks to nurses, pharmacists, clinical technicians, physicians, and other types of clinicians.

Plan every detail of your site’s consult hierarchy before ever trying to do the setup in production. It is critical not only to draw your entire hierarchy out on paper so that all tiers are perfectly clear, but also to speak with every service involved so that the correct users and hardware are identified at the time of the Setup. Doing this before the Consults Package is turned on in **V***IST***A** will save countless hours of frustration and misunderstanding later.

### Consults Install, Planning, and Implementation Checklist

This checklist can help you walk through the steps needed to implement the Consults package.

** NOTE:**  Important changes since Consults/Request Tacking Version 2.5 are emphasized with a note.  
**INSTALL NOTES**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) The Consult/Request Tracking V. 3.0 package installs automatically when CPRS V. 1.0 installed.  
**PLANNING NOTES**

**NOTE:** Effective with Consults/Request Tracking V. 3.0:  
1.  A service is only selectable for update/tracking if it is defined as part of the All Services hierarchy.  
1.  Disabled services can be left in the All Services hierarchy so their order results can be returned, but are not selectable in the ordering process.  
1.  Tracking services must be in the All Services hierarchy in order to receive forwarded consults. The tracking service can only be selectable in the order forwarding process if the user is an update user for the tracking service or its parent service.  
**Plan the Consult Service Hierarchy**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 1a. Identify services to receive consults.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 1b. Determine if the service should be selectable in the ordering process from CPRS.  
For some consults, the order may need to be sent to a Service control point for forwarding to a service that has been identified as a “Tracking Only” service. (Tracking Only services are not selectable during the initial CPRS order process.) If a service control point is desired, the tracking services should be sub-specialties under the control point service within the All Services hierarchy.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 1c. Determine if there should be a service that will be used as a “Grouper Only” (e.g., Inpatient Services, Outpatient Services, and Outside Services might be good services to define as groupers).  
**Consults Install, Planning, and Implementation Checklist, cont’d**

When a Grouper Only service is selected in the CPRS order process, the service hierarchy defined under the grouper service will be displayed for selection items. The Grouper Only cannot be selected to receive an order. The All Services service is a Grouper Only, provided to build the Consult Service hierarchy upon.  
**Plan Service Users and Notification Recipients**  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 2. Identify individuals at the receiving service who should be notified when a consult is being sent to the receiving service.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 3. Identify service teams of clinicians or service users who should receive notifications.  
Team definitions may be used in addition to (or in lieu of) naming individuals to receive notifications. The teams for each service may be broken down by hospital locations that the clinicians follow if desired.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 4. Identify individuals at the receiving service who will NOT receive notifications about new consults, but should be able to perform update capabilities for this service.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 5. Identify the service printers that will be used to automatically print Consult Form 513s when a consult order is received from CPRS.  
***

** NOTE:**  Effective with Consult/Request Tracking V. 3.0, all Consult Form 513 prints are done from Consult routines. OE/RR print templates are no longer used for consult prints.  
**Plan Specific Procedures or Requests for Service(s)**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 6a. *Optional*: Identify direct request or procedure orders that specific consult services may receive, which do not require a Consult. (e.g.,EKG: Portable)  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 6b. Plan questions/templates for ordering clinicians to be asked when the order is placed. This would become the text for the Reason for Request.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 7. Identify the types of information the Receiving Services will need to see for their patients in a Health Summary report.  
**Consults Install, Planning, and Implementation Checklist, cont’d**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 8. Identify Ordering Providers who should receive a notification when the Receiving Service has reached a resolution of *completed*, *denied*, or *discontinued* for a consult ordered by the provider.  
**TIU Setup**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 9. Plan your hospital’s TIU hierarchy. See the *Text Integration Utility (TIU) Implementation Guide* for details on this step.

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 10. If you have not already done so, install TIU\*1\*4.

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 11. Run the TIU DEFINE CONSULTS option.

** NOTE:**  If you do not run the TIU DEFINE CONSULTS option, no status update takes place when the TIU note is entered.  
***

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 12. Enter the rest of your planned TIU document hierarchy using the Manager Document Definition Menu.

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 13. Define consult document parameters using the *Document Parameter Edit* option.

** NOTE:**  We strongly recommend entering Yes to ALLOW \>1 RECORDS PER VISIT.  
#### IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (Abbreviated guidelines)

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 1. Add the GMRC MGR option menu to the ORMGR option menu, with a mnemonic of CS.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 2. Add the ORLP TEAM MENU option to GMRC MGR option menu, with a mnemonic of TE.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 3. Add the ORB NOT MENU option to the GMRC MGR option menu, with a mnemonic of NO.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 4. Add the GMRC GENERAL SERVICE USER, GMRC MEDICINE USER, or the GMRC PHARMACY USER menu to the menus of Consults users who need more functionality than the CPRS consults tab provides.  
**Consults Install, Planning, and Implementation Checklist, cont’d**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 5. (optional) Set up a team for each consult service. Use the *Team Mgmt Menu* option, ORLP TEAM MENU.

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 6. Turn on the NEW SERVICE CONSULT/REQUEST notification for each of the individuals who were identified to receive notifications. Use the *Enable/Disable Notifications* option of the NOTIFICATION MGMT MENU, ORB NOT MGR MENU.  
** NOTE:**  Unless Consult notifications are set to mandatory, individual users must use the *Enable/Disable My Notifications* option of the Notifications Management Menu to individually enable the notifications they want to receive.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 7. Turn on the CONSULT/REQUEST RESOLUTION notification for all the ordering provider users identified to receive this notification, or train them to do it themselves. Use the *Enable/Disable Notifications* option of the NOTIFICATION MGMT MENU, ORB NOT MGR MENU.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 8. Turn on the CONSULT/REQUEST CANCEL/HOLD notification for all the ordering providers identified to receive this notification, or train them to do it themselves. Use the *Enable/Disable Notifications* option of the NOTIFICATION MGMT MENU, ORB NOT MGR MENU.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 9. Define the Service hierarchy in the Request Services File (\#123.5) with the associated users and service printer. Use the *Set up Consult Services* option, GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 10. Add the *Set up Service Users* [GMRC SETUP SERVICE USERS] option to the users who are allowed to manage service users.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 11. Add the following two options to Service update users’ primary or secondary menu option: *Consult Tracking* [GMRC SERVICE TRACKING] and *Service Consults Pending Resolution* [GMRC RPT PENDING CONSULTS].  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 12a. (*Optional*. With V. 3.0, services do not need to be protocols to be included on the Add New Orders screen. Adding the service to the hierarchy makes it a valid orderable item.) Create Protocol entries in the PROTOCOL File for each Service that should appear on the Add New Orders Screens.  
**Consults Install, Planning, and Implementation Checklist, cont’d**

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 12b. Use the *Set up Consult Protocols* [GMRC SETUP PROTOCOLS] option to define these services as “Consult Types.” These Protocol entries will be created with a name prefix of “GMRCT.”  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 13a. *(Optional)* If direct request items were identified related to a RECEIVING SERVICE, create Protocol entries in the PROTOCOL File for each Direct Request Item which should appear on an Add New Orders Screen. Use the *Set up Consult Protocols* [GMRC SETUP PROTOCOLS] option to define these direct request items as “Procedure Requests.” These Protocol entries will be created with a name prefix of “GMRCR.”  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 13b. Add the “PROCEDURES...,” GMRCOR REQUEST protocol item to the OR GMENU OTHER ORDERS protocol menu. Use the *Protocol Menu Edit* [ORCL PROTOCOL MENU EDIT] option.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 14. If using a site-defined Form 513: Transfer Consult Form print formats (defined in File 100.23) needing changes to a local print format and make the changes needed. Then alter the Order Parameters file (\#100.99) Service Copy Header, Footer, or Body for the Consult Tracking Package.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 15. Turn on the Package Site Parameter “ON:” field for the Consult Tracking Package in the ORDER PARAMETERS FILE (\#100.99).  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 16a. Define Health Summary Types that the receiving services need.  
![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) 16b. Provide Health Summary options to appropriate service users and inform them of the Health Summary Type defined for their use.  
#### Multi-Site

![](1b9e45e828a2381d80122842e84caaca.png) Use the *Set up Consult Site Parameters* (PA) on the Consult Management menu to add multi-site or multi-division information to the Request Services list.  
***

## D. Dietetics

Dietetics Patch 6 is installed with CPRS, but it doesn’t require any set-up for CPRS.

## E. Health Summary

**New Health Summary parameter and option**

*GUI Health Summary Types* [ORW HEALTH SUMMARY TYPES]

This option allows you to set up a list of health summary types to be displayed on the GUI Reports tab. Don’t add health summaries that require additional prompting (e.g., for date ranges & occurrence limits) since the GUI cannot support this type of prompting.

**Patch GMTS\*2.7\*12**

This patch contains a new Health Summary component, *Selected Progress Notes*, which allows selection of specific Progress Notes Titles for display on Health Summaries. The Progress Notes, Discharge Summary, and CWAD components now extract data from TIU, rather than Progress Notes (GMRP) or Discharge Summary (GMRD). Care has been taken to assure that the formatting and content of the components have remained the same, except that the signature block information will now reflect the author’s (and cosigner’s) name and title at the time of signature, rather than displaying their current values at the time of output.

**Patch GMTS\*2.7\*14**

The purpose of Health Summary Patch 14 is to update the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine Health Summary to reflect Exam Sets on the Radiology Profile and Radiology Impression components. Diagnostic codes have been added to the profile, and the wording of labels, descriptions, and default header names has been changed from Radiology to Imaging to reflect the inclusion of Nuclear Medicine and other imaging types in the health summary data.

After the installation of this patch, Health Summary ADPACs should check the headers on Health Summary Types created prior to the installation of GMTS\*2.7\*14. Headers created prior to GMTS\*2.7\*14 can be edited through the *Create/Modify Health Summary Type* option. Health Summary ADPACs should review the components displayed when using the *Ad Hoc Health Summary* option. If header changes are needed, edit the header by using the *Edit Ad Hoc Health Summary Type* option.

GMTS\*2.7\*14 updates the default header names of the following entries in the Health Summary Component file \#142.1: RADIOLOGY IMPRESSION, RADIOLOGY IMPRESSION SELECTED, RADIOLOGY PROFILE, and RADIOLOGY STATUS. (This will take effect in health summary types created after this patch is installed⎯new health summary types will contain the new default headers.)

**Patch GMTS\*2.7\*15**

This patch updates the Current Orders, IV Pharmacy, Outpatient Pharmacy, and Unit Dose Pharmacy components, to make them compatible with new the file design in CPRS.

## F. Laboratory

Both the Lab package and the CPRS package contain site parameters for the CPRS-Lab interface. Previous options on the Lab Liaison Menu still operate to set parameters for CPRS. Lab patch LR\*5.2\*121 introduces new parameters options.

### Lab Site parameters set within CPRS

**Edit Site Local Terms**

After CPRS installation, each site must run this option to link terms used in the expert system to local terms. Terms like Serum Creatinine must be mapped to the lab test file.

### Lab Site parameters set within Lab

-   Some lab tests are not meant to be resulted. This is indicated in the Lab test file (\#60) and the Orderable Items file (\#101.43). In both files there is a field called TYPE. The field in both files is a set of codes which indicates if the lab test is to be resulted or not. The codes consist of I:Input, O:Output, B:Both and N:Neither. If the TYPE for a lab test in the Lab file or Orderable Item file is set to “I” or “N,” results will not be sent by lab. This may sometimes be set incorrectly and should be looked at when troubleshooting lab results-related notifications/alerts such as Lab Results, Abnormal Lab Results, Critical Lab Results, and STAT Results Available. If a lab results-related notification is not firing for a particular lab test, check the TYPE field for that test in the Lab Test and Orderable Items files. If it is “I” or “N” in either file, the results will not be posted via HL7 and the alert will not be sent.  
-   **Edit Hospital Site parameters**

    This option (on the OE/RR Interface Parameters menu on the Lab Liaison menu) sets the parameters used in the Lab – CPRS interface, by location, to define the maximum number of days for continuous lab orders, whether or not to ask for an urgency, and the default type of collection.

**Edit Hospital Site parameters example**

Many sites set CPRS up through a phased implementation, activating hospital locations as users become proficient with the software. Edit the administration schedules to create schedules for specific hospital locations.

### Lab Patch LR\*5.2\*121

This patch helps prepare sites for the release of OE/RR 3.0. All of the changes in this patch are compatible with OE/RR 2.5. This patch includes new routines, Data Dictionary changes, and new Options and Protocols. The majority of the changes introduced with this patch will not take effect until CPRS/OE/RR 3.0 is installed.

Associated patches that must be installed BEFORE LR\*5.2\*121:

LR\*5.2\*100

LR\*5.2\*127

LR\*5.2\*171

**Lab Interface, cont’d**

This patch requires the installation of patch LR\*5.2\*127, which has some new utilities to facilitate the linking of Laboratory Tests to the National VA Lab Codes found in file 64. This linking process needs to be done before the installation of OE/RR version 3 and should be done by Laboratory personnel familiar with all Laboratory Procedures, perhaps the Laboratory Information Manager.

This patch also includes some programmer APIs for retrieving lab results, by patient, in structured arrays and also in formatted arrays. These APIs are currently being used by OE/RR 3.0, Imaging, TIU and some HOST initiatives. These APIs will be documented as Supported References on FORUM as Integration Agreements.

**Implementation**

Inform Lab users that canceled tests are no longer removed from the Lab files. The tests are marked as canceled and a record of the cancellation is maintained and displayed on the various lab status displays.

The Clinical Coordinator and the Lab Coordinator need to decide if/when to implement the automatic cancellation of lab orders when a patient movement occurs. To set up this functionality, the Laboratory Site file requires changes to three fields, and the Protocol file requires addition of a new item to the DGPM Movement Events protocol.

**1**. Go into VA Fileman and select *Enter or Edit File Entries*.

Select the Laboratory Site file.

**Blood Bank Evaluations**

Since this patch contains a Blood Bank namespaced routine, the following

evaluations are necessary to be in compliance with FDA requirements.

THE CHANGE IN THE LRBLPE ROUTINE WAS CLEARED FOR INSTALLATION IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BY FDA OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH, ON 5-30-97.

PROBLEM: It is necessary to modify the Blood Bank software to create an HL7 message to update CPRS when a Blood Bank order is processed. This is so that no functionality is lost when CPRS 1.0 is installed at the sites, which will be dependent upon HL7 messages rather than direct global reads to display information to the user.

RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made are totally transparent to the user and have no effect on blood bank software functionality, therefore the risk is NONE.

EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Problems do not involve any software design safeguards for safety critical elements.

POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: Changes in this patch specific to the blood bank routine modified should have no impact on sites installing this patch.

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation of this patch.

**New Lab Options**

LR7O PAR DOMAIN Domain Level Parameter Edit  
LR7O PAR LOC Location Level Parameter Edit  
LR7O PAR PKG Package Level Parameter Edit  
LR7O PARAM MENU Update CPRS Parameters  
LR7O ORDER PARAMETERS Update CPRS with Lab order parameters  
LR7O SINGLE LAB TEST Update CPRS with Single Lab test  
LR7O ALL LAB TESTS Update CPRS with all Lab test parameters  
LRACC MERG Merge Accessions  
With the exception of LRACC MERG, these options are not used until OE/RR 3.0 is installed.

**Lab Interface, cont’d**

LRACC MERG is installed on the Lab Accessioning menu (LR IN). It is used to merge 2 accessions in one step. Before this option was created, it was necessary to delete tests from an accession and then add them back onto the appropriate accession. This had the effect of DCing an order and Adding an order in OE/RR. The Merge option now maintains all the links to the original Doctor’s order without DCing and adding new entries. See the option description for more information.

**New Protocols**

LR7O AP EVSEND OR ANATOMIC PATH =\> OE/RR ORDER MESSAGE  
LR7O BB EVSEND OR BLOOD BANK =\> OE/RR ORDER MESSAGE  
LR7O CH EVSEND OR LAB =\> OE/RR ORDER MESSAGE EVENT  
LR7O ALL EVSEND RESULTS LAB RESULTS =\> EXTERNAL PACKAGE  
These new Protocols create HL7 messages to be used by applications that want to receive orders, status updates, and completed lab results from the Lab package. When OE/RR 3.0 is released, it will connect to the EVSEND protocols to pick up the HL7 messages and create new orders.

If a package is only interested in messages that contain verified lab results, then the protocol LR7O ALL EVSEND RESULTS should be used to eliminate the need to look for result-only type messages (Control code=RE).

**Tricks & Tips**

**1.** Code to screen out the printing of LC Lab collect type orders on the service device:

File: OE/RR Print FORMAT  
Name: LAB REQUlSITlON  
Screen: I \$G(ORIFN),\$\$VALUE\^ORCSAVE2(ORIFN,”COLLECT”)’=”lc”  
**2.** Setting Up ASK URGENCY

ASK URGENCY: There are three different ways that this parameter will manifest itself. Other parameters that play a part in the decision tree are the DEFAULT URGENCY field in 69.9, which is a hospital-wide parameter and the FORCED URGENCY and HIGHEST URGENCY ALLOWED fields in File 60 (LABORATORY TEST File).

**This is how it works**

-   If ASK URGENCY = YES, DEFAULT URGENCY = ROUTINE and FORCED URGENCY = NULL, the user will he prompted for an urgency with a default of ROUTINE,

-   If ASK URGENCY = NO, DEFAULT URGENCY =ROU'I'INE and FORCED URGENCY = NULL, the user will not be prompted for an urgency and the default will he ROUTINE,

-   If ASK URGENCY = YES, DEFAULT URGENCY ROUTINE and FORCED URGENCY = STAT, the user will not he prompted for an urgency and the default will he STAT,

    The HIGHEST URGENCY field in File 60 is overridden by FORCED URGENCY and if ASK URGENCY is set to NO, then the test will he given the DEFAULT URGENCY even if it is higher than the HIGHEST URGENCY ALLOWED.

     **IMPORTANT POINT**: The DEFAULT URGENCY field in File 6.9S is a required field and will normally he set to ROUTINE. Remember that the ASK URGENCY prompt is defined by location, If you are ordering for a location that has not been entered into the HOSPITAL SITE multiple in File 69.9, the urgency will not he asked and the DEFAULT URGENCY will be used unless a FORCED URGENCY is defined.

## G. Pharmacy Packages

The Pharmacy packages relevant to CPRS are:

-   Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0 (released prior to CPRS)

-   Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0

-   Inpatient Medications V. 5.0

    IV

    Unit Dose

    Summaries of the set-up procedures for these packages are included on the following pages.

    **See the Pharmacy Technical Manuals for COMPLETE details on implementing and maintaining these packages.**

### G-1. Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)

**PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file**

When medication orders are entered through CPRS, the name and dose form of the medication to be administered will be selected from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (\#50.7). After the drug and dose form have been identified, the user will have the option of selecting from the list of the dispense drug(s). To provide this functionality, a new file was created by pharmacy to create the list of Orderable items available through CPRS. This new PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (\#50.7) is similar to the current PRIMARY DRUG file (\#50.3), but also includes a dose form field that will always be displayed along with the drug name.

The Pharmacy Orderable Item name can be printed on Inpatient reports, profiles, MAR labels etc., in place of the Primary Drug Name. The Pharmacy Orderable Item name will also print on Outpatient reports and profiles, along with the Dispense drug name. The only time this is not the case is when finishing an order entered through CPRS in which a Dispense drug was not chosen. A more detailed explanation is included in the Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 documentation. PDM contains the options necessary to create and populate the new PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (\#50.7).

The following page contains the options exported with this package used to complete all of the Pharmacy tasks required for the installation of Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 and Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.

Only devices with the sub-type C-VT will be allowed to be entered at the DISPLAY DEVICE prompt in the *Enter/Edit Display* option found on the *Bingo Board Manager* menu. Once a dedicated device is setup, the bingo board can be scheduled to automatically start and/or stop at user-defined times.

**MUMPS Audiofax (Telephone Refill Requests)**

If you are using MUMPS Audiofax to process telephone refill requests, a new VEXRX routine must be installed to interface with Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0. To install this routine, go to SHOP ALL on FORUM and in the TELEPHONE REFILL REQUESTS Basket, retrieve the message “VEXRX for Outpatient V. 7.” This message will contain the new VEXRX routine. This routine must be forwarded and installed on your production account.

 **Important :** You cannot process telephone refill requests (MUMPS Audiofax) without the new VEXRX routine.

### G-3. Inpatient Medications

**See the Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 Technical Manual for complete details on implementing and maintaining the package.**

### Inpatient Medications Conversion

**Order Conversion**

For version 5.0, the PRIMARY DRUG is replaced by ORDERABLE ITEM. Conversions are included with this version that copy data in the old DOSAGE ORDERED field (\#102) to the new DOSAGE ORDERED field (\#109), and determines and adds an ORDERABLE ITEM (\#108) to each order. Only orders that have a stop date less than 365 days prior to the 5.0 installation date will be converted. The installation date used by both methods described below is determined by the DATE KIDS BUILD LAST RUN field (\#20.2) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (\#59.7).

**Inpatient Medications, cont’d**

Order Location Codes will be standardized to **V** for the IV subfile of PHARMACY PATIENT file (\#55), **U** for the Unit Dose subfile of PHARMACY PATIENT file (\#55), and **P** for Orders in NON-VERFIED ORDERS file (\#53.1). On orders in the IV subfile of 55, a new field was added to the ACTIVITY LOG multiple which is a pointer to NEW PERSON file (\#200). This field ENTRY BY (\#6) is populated by taking the free text data from the ENTRY CODE field (\#.23) and determining the corresponding INTERNAL ENTRY NUMBER (IEN) in File 200. If the determination can not be made a mail message is sent to holders of the PSJI MGR key with these identified.

Two methods are used to perform this conversion:

**Background**

When version 5.0 is installed, a process is queued to run in the background and convert existing Inpatient Medications orders. After a patient’s orders have been processed, that patient’s IEN will be stored in the LAST PATIENT CONVERTED TO 5.0 field (\#25.1) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (\#59.7). This will be used to determine where the process should begin if it must be restarted. When all of the orders for a patient have been processed, the CONVERTED FOR VERSION 5.0? field (\#104) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (\#55) is set, showing the conversion has been accomplished for that patient. When all Inpatient Medications orders within the specified time frame on the system have been converted, the date/time the process completed will be stored in the DATE 5.0 CONVERSION COMPLETED field (\#25.2) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (\#59.7).

**Patient Selection**

Hooks have been added to convert the data “on the fly”, if an order is accessed before the background conversion completes and before the selected patient’s data has been converted by the background process. After converting the orders for the selected patient, the CONVERTED FOR VERSION 5.0? field (\#104) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (\#55) is set, showing the conversion has been accomplished for that patient.

**Pick List Conversion**

A new field , ORDERABLE ITEM, is added to the Pick List file (\#53.5). This field (\#.06) of the ORDER multiple is populated as part of this conversion and the cross-references are recompiled so that the pick lists are ready for use with Version 5.0

**Inpatient Medications, cont’d**

**Order Set Conversion**

The dispense drug is used to determine Orderable Item which replaces Primary Drug. Once this conversion occurs the Order Sets are ready for use with Version 5.0. If any order within an order set is found that has multiple dispense drugs matched to different Orderable Items, the Order Set is not converted. A mail message is sent to all holders of the RPHARM key with these Order Sets identified.

**Verification Data Conversion**

Additional cross references have been added to identify orders which have not been verified by nursing or pharmacy.

Inpatient Medications protocols will be installed into the PROTOCOL file (\#101). These protocols will be used for Inpatient Medication’s interactions with CPRS, and to trigger the appropriate order action when a patient movement is entered by MAS.

The data in the ACTIVITY LOG REASON file (\#53.3) will be deleted and rebuilt. This will be done to allow new entries to be added, and to update several existing entries.

Inpatient Medications List Templates will be installed into the LIST TEMPLATE file (\#409.61). These will be used for Inpatient Medication’s ListMan order processing functions.

These options are no longer used in Version 5.0 and will be deleted as part of the installation process.

| PSJU MGR       | Unit Dose package coordinator and/or Inpatient supervisor, for editing of basic background files and various management reports. |

The PSJ RPHARM supersedes the other two keys - if a user is assigned the PSJ RPHARM key and either of the other two keys, the user will be seen by the package as a Pharmacist. In the same manner, the PSJ RNURSE key supersedes the PSJ PHARM TECH key.

| Pharmacists, Supervisors, and Pharmacy Package Coordinator | PSJI MGR                 |  
2\. Key allocation: In order for the package coordinator to have access to the *Supervisor’s Menu*, he or she must hold the PSJI MGR key. Certain users allowed to purge orders (usually the package coordinator) must hold the PSJI PURGE key.

3\. The background option *PSJI BACKGROUND JOB* should be scheduled to run nightly by someone in your IRM Service or ADP Department. This option compiles the IV statistical data for each day.

**Inpatient Medications, cont’d**

4\. The functionality accomplished by the following options has been moved to PDM:

#### Site Parameters (IV) [PSJI SITE PARAMETERS]

This option allows the package coordinator to define the characteristics of the IV room and/or satellites to the package. Such things as manufacturing and delivery times, label size, use of suspense, and same day IV order expiration are identified. This information is stored in the IV ROOM file (\#59.5). You must define at least one IV room in order for the IV module to function correctly. You can, at any time, alter the definition of the IV room, and you do not have to exit the module and re-enter for the change to be in effect.

To enter or edit the IV ROOM file, choose the following sequence of options:

DRUG file.

ORDERABLE ITEM.

WARD GROUP file.

MEDICATION ROUTES file.

INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file.

INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS file.

## H. Problem List

Problem List doesn’t require any set-up for CPRS.

Patch GMPL\*2\*10 contains changes needed to support CPRS:

New APIs were created to provide data to CPRS.

## I. Radiology/Nuclear Medicine

**Radiology Patch RA\*4.5\*11**

This purpose of this patch is to:

-   support OE/RR v.3 (CPRS) nature of order activity functionality,

-   support CPRS quick order conversion prior to installation of CPRS,

-   provide a CPRS HL7 interface to purge orders,

-   correct various bugs in the Rad/OE3 interface, and

-   provide a few other miscellaneous interface fixes and enhancements.

    All CPRS-related functionality will be “invisible” to ADPACs and end users until CPRS is installed.

-   In the Rad/Nuc Med Reason file \#75.2, field NATURE OF ORDER ACTIVITY (\#4) has been added. After CPRS is installed, Rad/Nuc Med ADPACs will need to assign each reason in this file to a CPRS code. This code will determine (for order hold and cancel reasons) whether or not a chart copy will be printed, whether an electronic signature is needed, and whether this action should be printed on the CPRS summary. The *Reason Edit* [RA REASON EDIT] option has been modified to allow editing this new field if CPRS is installed. Prior to installing CPRS this field will also be “invisible.”

-   The RACOMDEL routine included with this patch will be executed upon the installation of CPRS (OE/RR v3). If there are multiple entries in the Rad/Nuc Med Common Procedure file 71.3 pointing to the same procedure in the Rad/Nuc Med Procedure file \#71, this routine will remove the duplicates, leaving the entry that is active on the common procedure list. It may also resequence the common procedure list causing the identifying numbers to change on user displays. This is necessary to insure that the orderable item updates sent from Rad/Nuc Med to CPRS work properly. This will have no effect on sites until CPRS is installed.

-   The [RA COMMON PROCEDURE EDIT] template for the Rad/Nuc Med Common Procedure file \#71.3 and routines RAORDU, RAORDU1 and RAMAIN2 have been modified to support a future OE/RR 2.5 patch which will convert quick orders prior to installation of CPRS (OE/RR 3.0). Changes in Rad/Nuc Med will use the existence or absence of file 101.41 to detect whether the OE/RR patch is installed. If the OE/RR patch is installed, the orderable item update HL7 messaging will be turned on to continuously update the new CPRS file whenever Rad/Nuc Med ADPACs add/edit a procedure or change its status on the common procedure lists.

## J. Text Integration Utilities (TIU)

The Text Integration Utilities (TIU) package consists of Progress Notes, Discharge Summary, and a set of utilities for managing clinical documents. Progress Notes and Discharge Summary can be accessed directly through TIU for one or more patients, or through CPRS for individual patients. TIU is closely tied to Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU), which helps to define roles and business rules (who can do what to TIU documents). Other clinical document applications, such as Consult/Request can use its utilities for uploading documents into **V***IST***A**, or to take advantage of the document definition hierarchy benefits, boilerplating, and other features of TIU.

**Setting up Consult/Request Tracking in TIU**

You can set Consults up as a separate Class (comparable to Discharge Summary or Progress Notes) or you can define Consults as a Document Class under Progress Notes. There are pros and cons to either strategy.

**A:** *Create Consults as an independent CLASS, under Clinical Documents*

**Pro:** 1. Provides a *clear* separation of Consults from Progress Notes, and minimizes the number of choices for the end-user.

2\. Simple, with few concerns for maintainability (e.g., no question as to whether heritable methods and properties of Progress Notes were appropriately overridden, etc.).

**Con**: 1. Not necessarily consistent with the way providers have been documenting their Consult Results in the past. (i.e., if they've been using PN titles to “result” consults, and referring to the notes on the 513's in the past, this will be a departure from that practice).

2\. Limits flexibility of access to the information. (i.e., if set up this way, they may only access the data through Integrated Document Management options on the TIU side, and through the Consults tab of the CPRS chart).

**B:** *Create Consults as a Document Class under Progress Notes.*

**Pro**: 1. Consistent with the way many providers have been documenting their Consult Results in the past.

2\. Enhances flexibility of access to the information. (allows access to data through any option in TIU, as well as through *either* the Consults or Progress Notes tabs of the CPRS chart).

**Con**: 1. Does not provide a clear separation of Consults from Progress Notes, and may offer too many choices for the end-user.

2\. Complex, with some concerns for maintainability (e.g., if printing or filing appear incorrect, may result from heritable methods and properties of Progress Notes not being appropriately overridden, etc.).

**TIU, cont’d**

**Define CONSULTS for TIU/CT Interface**

Patch TIU\*1.0\*4 contains an option that allows you to set Consults up as part of the Document Definition hierarchy. The following is a description of the option and the other steps necessary for allowing Consults to be accessed through TIU and CPRS.

1\. Select the option *Define Consults for TIU/CT Interface* and enter the relevant information.

Select OPTION NAME: **TIU DEFINE CONSULTS** Define CONSULTS for  
TIU/CT Interface  
Define CONSULTS for TIU/CT Interface  
***

I'm going to create a new Document Definition for CONSULTS now.  
***

GREAT! A new Document Definition has been created for CONSULTS.  
Next, you need to decide whether you want CONSULTS to be set up  
as a separate CLASS (comparable to DISCHARGE SUMMARY or PROGRESS  
NOTES), or whether you want CONSULTS defined as a DOCUMENT CLASS  
under PROGRESS NOTES. The benefits of each strategy are outlined  
in the POST-INSTALLATION instructions for this patch.  
***

NOTE: If you're not yet CERTAIN which strategy you want your site  
to adopt, then quit here, and get consensus first (it's easier to  
get permission than forgiveness, in this case)!  
***

Select one of the following:  
***

CL Class  
DC Document Class  
***

Define CONSULTS as a CLASS or DOCUMENT CLASS: DC Document Class  
***

Okay, you've indicated that you want to make CONSULTS a Document Class.  
***

Okay to continue? NO// **YES**  
***

FANTASTIC! Your NEW DOCUMENT CLASS CONSULTS will now be added under  
the PROGRESS NOTES Class...  
***

Okay, I'm done...Please finish your implementation of CONSULTS by adding  
any Titles as appropriate using the Create Document Definitions Option  
under the TIUF DOCUMENT DEFINITION MGR Menu, as described in Step \#3 of  
the Post-Installation Instructions.  
***

Press RETURN to continue...  
**TIU, cont’d**

2\. You can verify that the upload header is appropriately defined for Consults using the option [TIU UPLOAD HELP]. The output will look something like this:

\<Message Header Signal\>: CONSULTS  
TITLE: CARDIOLOGY CONSULT  
SSN: 000-00-0001  
VISIT/EVENT DATE: 5/13/97@08:00

-   File should be ASCII with width no greater than 80 columns.

-   Use "@@@" for “BLANKS” (word or phrase in dictation that isn’t understood), where \<Message Header Signal\> and \<Begin Text Signal\> will appear as you’ve defined them in your Upload Parameters for your site (e.g., \$HDR and \$TXT, etc.).

    3\. Use the *Create Document Definitions* option [TIUFC CREATE DDEFS MGR], under the IRM Maintenance Menu option [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU], to construct a new document definition sub-tree for Consults that looks something like this:

    **Edit Document Definitions** Sep 03, 1997 11:59:04 Page: 1 of 1  
BASICS  
Name Type  
1 CLINICAL DOCUMENTS CL  
2 +DISCHARGE SUMMARY CL

Boilerplate Text Name/Owner/PrintName... Copy/Move  
Select Action: Quit//  
**TIU, cont’d**

The example above suggests a Service-oriented set of Document Classes with

one or more titles under each. Of course, just like Progress Notes, these

can include boilerplate text with embedded objects. It will probably

take some time, with substantial cooperation between your Clinical

Coordinator, IRMS, and the Consulting Services, to develop a complete set

of Document Definitions for Consults at your site.

4\. Next, define a set of Document Parameters for the new Consults class, using the Document Parameter Edit [TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER EDIT] option under the TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU option, as follows:

1 TIU Parameters Menu ...  
2 Document Definitions (Manager) ...  
3 User Class Management ...  
***

Select TIU Maintenance Menu Option: **1** TIU Parameters Menu  
***

If document is to be uploaded, specify Filing Alert Recipients:  
***

Select FILING ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS:  
***

Now enter the USER CLASSES for which cosignature will be required:  
***

Select USERS REQUIRING COSIGNATURE: STUDENT//  
Now enter the DIVISIONAL parameters:  
***

Select DIVISION: [optional...you probably won't need to set up  
auto-printing devices]  
***

Press RETURN to continue...  
**TIU, cont’d**

5\. Finally, use the option to Manage Business Rules, under the User Class Management Menu to specify the following rules, allowing Linking (or re-linking) of TIU documents with “requests” in a client application:

1 An UNSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may be LINKED by An AUTHOR/DICTATOR  
***

2 An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may be LINKED by An EXPECTED  
COSIGNER  
***

3 A COMPLETED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may be LINKED by A CHIEF, MIS  
***

4 An UNSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may be LINKED by A MEDICAL

# V. Troubleshooting

**NOTE:** See the CPRS Troubleshooting page on the CPRS home page.

**Q.** How do sites handle document verification (nurse and clerk)? Do they still print 24-hour summaries, chart copies, etc. for nurses and clerks to initial? How would they know, otherwise, what’s been done?

**A.** West Palm Beach requires online verification. Nurses do the majority of the verification, and they do this online, periodically throughout the day, at designated workstations on the wards or clinics. Some copies are printed and put in the chart for contingencies and backup, but basically, it’s a paperless system.

**Q:**  Where do you enter comments on an order?

**A:** You can add them under Ward Comments, under the Flag action, or in a Notification.

**Q.** What are the benefits of a GUI over the traditional **V***IST***A** programs or the List Manager version of CPRS?

**A.** A Windows-type environment (GUI) allows you to do many things easier and more efficiently. The visibility and accessibility of many components of a patient record allow you to move among them more freely to review and link data. You can choose your own workflow rather than having it dictated by the computer in a sequential way. Sometimes, the traditional roll ‘n’ scroll and List Manager have advantages. For straightforward data entry, these methods can be faster and less complex.

**Q:** My List Manager Screens aren’t displaying or scrolling right; are there any reasons for this, or settings I can change?

**A:** You may have to update the Terminal Type file for the VT100. If the "Insert Line" field is empty, which for some reason is not uncommon, this will cause List Manager to revert back to scroll mode - which may also be contributing to the weirdness you've been seeing on the screen.

**Q:** Chart copies are not printing to the clinics when placing med orders thru the GUI. I have the print parameters for Location set to print a chart copy to print to specific devices and under packages (still within the Location Print Parameter setup) to print outpatient meds to a specific device in Pharmacy. Orders are printing to pharmacy, however, the chart copies are not printing to the location (which happens to be clinic locations). Works ok in List Mgr. Question: Is the GUI capable of handlign this functionality?

**A:** Printing of chart copies works in the GUI if the location is set up to auto-print. The GUI can't prompt for a chart copy print device. You may want to use the List Values option on the XPAR MENU TOOLS option to check the values for the parameters ORPF PROMPT FOR CHART COPY and ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE. If the values for the location in question are DON'T PROMPT and a valid device is listed, the chart copies should auto print.

**Q:** How do you correct Vitals entered in error in the GUI?

**A:** You have to enter a new order to replace the incorrect one. Since the Vitals/Measurement files will not store more than one of any one type of measurement for one encounter (patient, location, date/time), if you enter a new vital for the encounter, it replaces the old one.

**Q:** When our clinicians are selecting an image type while ordering radiology exams in the GUI, they get a message box that says "not a valid integer value." It appears to be machine-specific (3 or more PCs are experiencing it). Any ideas?

**A:** Two sites reported this problem. In one case it was Express Meter running as a local process on the workstations. They ended the EM32.EXE process on the local workstation and this resolved the problem. In the other case, it was the Microsoft Intellipoint program, and they removed POINT32.EXE to correct the problem.

**Q:**  Our CAC and others reported that when a name is typed in the Patient Selection box (before selection is entered), a display of the patient's SSN, DOB, and age automatically appears. This is not consistent with the way VistA handles sensitive patients. The appearance of the display is indiscriminate, and occurs for all types of patients. Can this be changed in a future version of the CPRS GUI?

**A:** In doing some investigation in a roll-and-scroll as opposed to GUI, you see the same thing. In a roll-and-scroll, the following appears:

Select Patient: Change View// CPRSPATIENT1,THREE 11-00-50 000000013 NO NSC VETERAN  
\*\*\* WARNING \*\*\*  
\*\*\* RESTRICTED RECORD \*\*\*  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  
\* This record is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. If you elect \*  
\* to proceed, you will be required to prove you have a need to know. \*  
\* Accessing this patient is tracked, and your station Security Officer \*  
\* will contact you for your justification. \*  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  
Do you want to continue processing this patient record? No// (No)  
In roll-and-scroll, you still see the SSN, DOB, and Service connection as these are identifiers.

In the CPRS GUI, at the Patient Selection window, if the same patient is clicked on, we see just below and to the left of the OK and CANCEL buttons:

CPRSPATIENT1,THREE SSN: 000-00-0001 DOB: Nov 00,1950 Female, age 48 Veteran

So both formats, although displayed differently, are showing the same data.

If this isn't the way you are seeing the lookup on the VistA side, it may be because you have a local modification in place to hide identifiers if the patient is sensitive.

**MISS Position**

Here is input from the security folks on this issue in relation to the CPRS GUI lookup⎯the original dialog as well as the response from MISS.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Message sent on May 1, 1998:

We had a site raise a concern about the way CPRS does the display of identifers from the patient selection screen. I feel we're mimicking what is done on the roll and scroll (DPTLK) side of things, but I'd like to start a dialog.

When you type in a partial name or ?? in DPTLK, you get a list of choices to choose from. After the patient name, the date of birth, SSN, and patient type are displayed along with locally created identifiers. Nothing is stored. In the GUI, a list box is displayed of patient names. If you highlight the patient name, the above information displays to the right of the listbox. The site in question feels this is a confidentiality issue. Again, nothing is stored in terms of logging a hit on a sensitive record until the record is actually selected from the list. In MAS, this issue came up at least once a year. There were always requests for items to be left of when there was a sensitive patient involved. The problem was always pointed out was that not showing the information could lead to the wrong patient being selected. Additionally, it was pointed out that users sign an access agreement letter agreeing to not use the information in the system other than for official business. To my knowledge, no change was ever approved.

The particular site in question has modified DPTLK locally to NOT show any identifiers for a sensitive patient. They are asking for the same change to be made nationally with the GUI. I guess the bottom line is there are two issues:

1\. Do you feel we are sufficiently mimicking what is in DPTLK?

2\. Are there changes planned to DPTLK to address this issue?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response from Sarah Daly, MISS: This is a frequently asked question by ISOs and employees. The purpose of presenting these data fields to users is to uniquely and unambiguously identify computer entries. In this case the data fields are people's identifiers. This practice is established in tradition by long use in DHCP. This is a privacy issue only in the context that the information is used subsequently to invade the individual's privacy. The security issue is loss of confidentiality.

The following three paragraphs outline VHA's countermeasures against the threat of breach of confidentiality, including this instance of it.

1\. VHA's information security program emphasizes training of all users. This includes sensitizing users to the responsibility they have for maintaining the confidentiality of information they access, view, and use. They are responsible for using these data in a pre- determined manner.

2\. In addition, DHCP has technical mechanisms built in (password challenges, menus, keys, access attributes) that can limit access of data to only that set of users that need them in the discharge of their official duties. The system incorporates mechanisms for applying and reviewing audits of system events, including the ability to follow user activity. Facilities can apply additional security on locally-selected records to detect who accessed the records. This is the "sensitive record" review.

3\. Finally, facility management has staff in place that manages all the training, technical, and administration components of the system. This includes periodic review of information security.

When combined with administrative and legal recourse that can be taken against violators, these mechanisms and procedures ensure that personal data are protected to the extent required to accommodate both privacy concerns and easy data access. The VA's O.G.C. (Office of the General Counsel) has provided an Advisory Opinion (AO 1- 93) on this subject. They interpreted Privacy Act as allowing VA to use SSNs and dates of birth as identifiers to look up and select patients.

**Key Option for Troubleshooting Order Checking**  
Order Checking Mgmt Menu  
Display the Order Checks a User Can Receive  
**Q:** When I write an order for digoxin and quinidine at the same time, the order check does not seem to take place until after it would with an order check between a new med and an old one. Did I understand that correctly?

**A**: Your observations are correct regarding the order checking against new meds vs. old meds. Almost all medication-related order checks are performed by querying the pharmacy package. During the ordering process, pharmacy does not know about the meds placed during the ordering session. Meds are not “released” to the pharmacy service until they have been signed so checks between meds placed in the session cannot occur. Checks against meds already released to Pharmacy occur within the ordering process. Checking is postponed until after the session is completed (just before electronic signature), because order checks are fairly resource-intensive and this minimizes the delays between prompts.

**Q:** I’m having trouble disabling duplicate order checks. Can you give more information about how the different levels affect this?

**A:** You can disable the duplicate order checks through the Order Checking Mgmt menu, option \#1 Enable/Disable an Order Check. Do this at the Division level if the site is “multi-division”; otherwise, do it at the System level. Of course, if one of the users has the User level value set to “Enabled” they will still get the order check. Or if the patient Location value for the patient they are working with is “Enabled,” they will get the

Order Check. Or if the user’s service has the value of “Enabled,” users of that service will get that Order Check. Most Order Checks are exported with the Package level set to “Enabled.”

**Order Checks and Notifications Troubleshooting, cont’d**

**Q:** Why don’t some lab results produce notifications?

**A:** Some lab tests are not meant to be resulted. This is indicated in the Lab test file (\#60) and the Orderable Items file (\#101.43). In both files there is a field called TYPE. The field in both files is a set of codes which indicates if the lab test is to be resulted or not. The codes consist of I:Input, O:Output, B:Both and N:Neither. If the TYPE for a lab test in the Lab file or Orderable Item file is set to "I" or "N", results will not be sent by lab. This rarely is set incorrectly, but is something to look at when troubleshooting lab results-related notifications/alerts such as Lab Results, Abnormal Lab Results, and Critical Lab Results. If a lab results-related notification is not firing for a particular lab test, check the TYPE field for that test in the Lab Test and Orderable Items files. If it is "I" or "N" in either file, the results will not be posted via HL7 and the alert will not be sent.

** NOTE:** Both “Enabled” and “Mandatory” override lower-level entity values. Both override a system value of “Disabled.” This was requested by users to reduce confusion over the two values and how they impact notification processing.

The lab series of alerts have been altered to work in conjunction as follows:

1\. Users who work from lab results should have the Lab Results alert enabled and the Abnormal Lab Results alerts disabled.

2\. All other users (most clinicians) should enable the Abnormal Lab Results (Action) or Abnormal Lab Results (Info) alerts and disable the Lab Results alert.

3\. The Critical Lab Results alerts are usually mandatory and sent to everyone linked to the patient or the order.

4\. Abnormal Lab Results (action) and Lab Results have follow-up actions that show the results of the order for abnormal/critical tests and normal tests. For most users, they should have one of these alerts enabled but not both.

5\. Abnormal Lab Results (Info) and Critical lab results (Info) display the result and collection date/time in the message and have no follow-up.

With these alerts, users can get alerts for all or abnormal lab results, then see the actual results of the order via follow-up action. To supplement this, critical lab results are displayed.

Another item to remember is that alerts can be disabled for a patient location. This feature of CPRS was specifically included to reduce the number of abnormal and critical lab alerts for patients in critical care units like ICU. Patient location is enabled or disabled by the *Enable/Disable Notifications* option, then selecting “Location.” This option is not available on end user Notification Mgmt menus, only via ORMGR and clinical coordinator menus.

**Order Checks and Notifications Troubleshooting, cont’d**

**Q:** Is there is a way to downgrade a “critical” order check to “significant” so that an override reason is not required?

**A:** To reduce the “Clinical Danger Level” of an order check, you need access to the Order Checking Management menu for managers. (This parameter is set at the Division or System level so it is not available to all users.) Under the Order Checking Mgmt menu select *Set Clinical Danger Level for an Order Check*. Depending on if you are setting it for a single site or more than one site in a consolidated system, select Division or System. Next enter DUP DRUG ORDER as the order check. Enter “Moderate” as the value. Only “High” valued order checks require an override reason. You should no longer be prompted for override reason for this order check.

**Q:** In version 2.5, there was a Clinical Coordinator option in ORLB TEAM MGMT to: TRIGGER A TEST NOTIFICATION (ORB NOT TEST). This action option runs a routine which triggers a test notification. The notification is processed and sent to the identified recipient. Because the new notifications module is much more complex, I think having the ability to fire off a test alert would aid Clinical Coordinators & CPRS Mgrs in troubleshooting and assisting users.

**A:** This already exists but with greatly extended flexibility. Try using the *Determine Recipients for a Notification* option under the Notification Mgmt menu. Another way to trigger a “test” notification/alert is to “flag” an existing order. The Order Requires Clarification alert will go to the provider who entered /requested the order. You could set up a test order on a test patient and flag/unflag the order forever to keep triggering the alert.

Along with the alert message is an indication that the View Alerts common option should be chosen to take further action.

**Application**  A person at a hospital or clinic assigned to coordinate the

**Coordinator (ADPAC)** automated data processing (ADP) activities in a specific department. This person is usually a specialist in his or her department (e.g., a medical technologist or a pharmacist) first and the applications coordinator second. These specialists are also known as Clinical Coordinators or Clinical Application Coordinators (CAC) when they are associated with OE/RR, CPRS, and clinical applications.

**Application Program-** Programmer calls provided for use by application

**ming Interface (API)** programmers. APIs allow programmers to carry out standard computing activities without needing to duplicate Kernel utilities in their own packages. APIs also further Database Administration (DBA) goals of system integration by channeling activities, such as adding new users, through a limited number of callable entry points.

**Consult/Request**  Also known as Consults. Consults can function as part of

**Tracking** CPRS, independently as a standalone package, or as part of TIU). Consults are referrals of patients by the primary care physician to another hospital service/specialty, to obtain a medical opinion based on patient evaluation and completion of any procedures, modalities, or treatments the consulting specialist deems necessary to render a medical opinion. For instance, if a primary care physician orders a patient evaluation from Cardiology Service, and the cardiology specialist orders an Electrocardiogram (EKG) to complete the evaluation and provide an opinion concerning the patient’s condition, this type of order is considered a “Consult.”

**DLL** Dynamic Link Library. A DLL allows executable routines to be stored separately as files with a DLL extension. These routines are only loaded when a program calls for them. DLLs provide several advantages:

1\. DLLs help save on computer memory, since memory is only consumed when a DLL is loaded.

2\. DLLs ease maintenance tasks. Because the DLL is a separate file, any modifications made to the DLL will not affect the operation of the calling program or any other DLL.

3\. DLLs help avoid redundant routines. They provide generic functions that can be utilized by a variety of programs.

Appendix B: West Palm Beach's description for GUI menu creation

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As requested on the CPRS call yesterday, here are some differences between

the two XPAR parameters that control what appears in the Write Orders box

on the Orders tab of the CPRS GUI.

The GUI is distributed with the standard ordering dialogs entered into the

ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST parameter at the Package level.

Example:

Sequence Value

\-------- -----

20 GMRAOR ALLERGY ENTER/EDIT

30 FHW1

52 PSJ OR PAT OE

55 PSO OERR

58 PSJI OR PAT FLUID OE

60 LR OTHER LAB TESTS

70 RA OERR EXAM

80 GMRCOR CONSULT

85 GMRCOR REQUEST

90 GMRVOR

99 OR GXTEXT WORD PROCESSING ORDER

The advice nationally has been to add/delete from this list or to build a

customized list at the System level. This is what West Palm Beach and

many others sites have done.

Example:

Sequence Value

\-------- -----

2 GMRAOR ALLERGY ENTER/EDIT

5 FHW1

7 GMRVOR

10 PSJ OR PAT OE

15 PSJI OR PAT FLUID OE

20 PSO OERR

25 LR OTHER LAB TESTS

26 ORZ GMENU GUI LAB QUICK

28 ORZ GMENU GUI LAB ONCE

30 RA OERR EXAM

40 OR GXTEXT WORD PROCESSING ORDER

44 ORZ GMENU GUI CONSULTS MAIN

47 ORZ GMENU GUI ER MAIN

50 ORZ ADD MENU CLINICIAN

Some noted limitations/problems with this approach include:

\#1. Maintenance! The XPAR menu is difficult for even IRM staff to get to,

it is not very friendly (there is no edit template for ORWOR WRITE ORDERS

LIST), and thus the CACs generally cannot maintain what appears there.

\#2. Need for care when controlling what folks see. If you have a group of

users that you want to limit access or give special access to, you must

re-enter all items you want them to have at the individual USER level.

(possible E3R or NOIS for the enterprising--the Location level does not

appear to have any effect on the limited tests I have done)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Some ways around these limitations can be found by using the approach

pioneered in VISN 8 by CACs Ruth Gorman and Regina Crane with the

fantastic support of their IMS support Prima! During testing for CPRS

they discovered that if you put an add order screen into the XPAR

parameter ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST, that the contents of that menu appear

in the Write Orders box on the Orders Tab of CPRS GUI.

This parameter is also a bit more flexible because where you can assign

ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST only to Package, System, Location and User, ORWDX

WRITE ORDERS LIST can be assigned to System, Division, and User. Since

Gainesville and Lake City are integrated, the divisional parameter was

particularly useful for them.

Prima made a very simple order screen that had all the order dialogs

listed above in the same order, then she made an empty generic order

dialog with display text of --------------------- to create a line in the

list of items in the Write Orders box, and placed the local menus or

dialogs below that. The menu was only 1 column wide, and it mimicked the

functionality of the ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST perfectly!

This made maintenance a breeze for the CACs because they only had to edit

the menu through their CAC tools (Menu Management) and the changes would

be reflected in the GUI--no IRM involvement.

While IRM still needs to help when you are restricting/changing access for

individual users... once a user has an individual or group menu assigned

via this parameter, any subsequent changes you might need to make to them

can easily be made by simply editing the contents of the menu they have

assigned to them.

An example of how this parameter entry looks:

Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST Menu

ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST may be set for the following:

2 User USR [choose from NEW PERSON]

7 Division DIV [WEST PALM BEACH, FL]

8 System SYS [WEST-PALM.VA.GOV]

Enter selection: 2 User NEW PERSON

Select NEW PERSON NAME: CPRSPROVIDER1,THREE CT 711

\--------- Setting ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST for User: CPRSPROVIDER1,THREE -

Order Dialog: orz add menu test

1 ORZ ADD MENU TEST

2 ORZ ADD MENU TEST COFFEY

3 ORZ ADD MENU TEST2

4 ORZ ADD MENU TESTING MODE

CHOOSE 1-4: 1 ORZ ADD MENU TEST

ORWDX WRITE ORDERS LIST may be set for the following:

2 User USR [choose from NEW PERSON]

7 Division DIV [WEST PALM BEACH, FL]

8 System SYS [WEST-PALM.VA.GOV]

Enter selection:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Now you will ask me... it is four months down the road and a user is

calling with a problem, how can I figure out which menu they have assigned

in the GUI? Great question!!!

That used to be held directly in the new person file, then it moved to the

Parameter file.... so... In fileman (or your IRM can make an option for

you) can do a search or a print or enter edit. For me, right now, I get

the most reliable results from enter/edit, even though it is a bit of a

pain (mostly because my searches come up empty--grin). I am in to test

many things and I have set many of my own personal parameters to see how

they work so that I can teach others, so my list is very long! A "Common

User" would have a shorter list (Typically \<20). Anyway, here is your

example using me, I hope this helps!
